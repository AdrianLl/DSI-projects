Racines NY,"94 Chambers St., New York, NY 10013", French,"The American outpost of this popular Parisian original cuts an elegant figure, with its wide marble bar and pristine flower arrangements. Throw in romantic low lighting, brick-lined walls and a tony TriBeCa address-and you have quite the operation. The service can be a bit off-putting, which is a shame because Racines NY has an ace, even affordable, wine list that bears discussion and recommendations. As for the food, you'll pay for all that sexy ambience a little more than the cuisine currently merits-but certain dishes, like a rich chicken liver mousse served with grilled breads, make for an elegant bar snack. Paired with one of those excellent wines by the glass and a seat at that handsome bar, you have a recipe for a glam night on the town.	","[

White tiled walls, amazing artwork, and lovely fresh flowers ensure that the well-designed dining room feels cheery and comfortable. Generous space between tables promises privacy. Local and seasonal ingredients dictate the menu, especially in the raw and cured section-Long Island fluke or Peconic Bay scallops are simple, fresh opening acts. Purple and orange carrots are roasted until tender, topped in crisp breadcrumbs, then beautifully plated with a tangy black garlic aïoli. A burgundy-hued beetroot risotto is studded with goat cheese. Brimming with cuttlefish, clams, and mussels, the spiced shellfish ragù is downright outstanding.	","[

Rosanjin,"141 Duane St., New York, NY 10013", Japanese,"From its ultra-discrete entrance to its heavily curtained windows, everything about this elegant TriBeCa Japanese restaurant spells delicious rendezvous. Should you be lucky enough to find your way into Rosanjin's barely marked entrance, you'll discover a sleek, sophisticated and oh-so-private dining room with soft jazz music that reads tranquil even when it's full. Despite its tony address and well-heeled clientele, Rosanjin retains a sort of bonhomie from another era-it's not uncommon for the chef to hand-deliver a few of your dishes with a heartfelt thank you. It's a gesture of gratitude you're likely to return after witnessing the stunning composition on your plate. A typical kaiseki meal here would feature a bright selection of sushi, some of it scored to deliver that perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience; and might include a delicate (and dramatic) starter of lobster and uni, suspended in a jellied dashi broth and served in a glass with a wispy cloud of orange dry ice. Then, an excellent chawan mushi may follow, with salty caviar, tender oyster mushrooms, fresh uni, and chives; or a delicious clear soup with a scallop mousse dumpling, mountain yam, mountain greens, and ginger.

Brushstroke,"30 Hudson St., New York, NY 10013", Japanese,"The name may not give too much away but as soon as you enter you just know you're in a Japanese restaurant. It's probably all that calming wood-there's enough here of assorted hues and from various sources to excite the woodsman in us all. Or it could be the L-shaped counter behind which chefs go about their work with studied determination; or more probably, it's the sight of graciously polite servers carrying bowls, boards, and cups containing delicate dishes of infinite beauty. This joint venture between David Bouley and Yoshiki Tsuji aims to showcase the beauty, subtlety, harmony, and precision that is Japanese cuisine. This isn't the place for sushi-you go next door for that. Instead, it serves seasonally pertinent dishes that are a joy to behold, but where the art never comes at the expense of taste. The Washu beef sukiyaki, for example, has a wonderful depth of flavor. Desserts, such as sake crème brûlée, have more obvious European parentage but are still light, delicate creations. Indeed, such is the nature of the food here that one can, unlike with many styles of restaurant, still engage in constructive work afterwards.	","[

Enter the narrow Federal-style home (c. 1810) and sidle up to the beautiful people along the pew seats overlooking a poster of the Marlboro Man, or head on to the aptly named Bar Upstairs. The food may be American but seamlessly weaves in Italian influences. Creamy burrata arrives over date purée, glazed in lemon-honey and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Hake is thickly cut and enticingly flaky, drizzled in brown butter with tart capers, lemon, and parsley, then complemented with both pan-roasted fingerling potatoes and beautifully dressed frisée salad. Even their delicate California chardonnay harkens to old-world flavors.	","[

Like watching a re-run of Seinfeld, it is reassuringly familiar, classically New York and, even when you know what's coming next, still eminently satisfying. The menu is a roll-call of everyone's favorites, from chicken paillard to beet salad, burgers to cheesecake. Cocktails are well made and beers carefully poured. Dishes are executed with sufficient care and portions are of manageable proportions. The room comes with an appealing art deco feel and the terrace at the front pulls in the occasional passer-by. Service is personable and willing too, although after all this time the place could probably run itself.	","[

Abundant candles produce more atmosphere than light for the rustic room clad in exposed brick and salvaged wood. Aloof servers dressed in black seem to disappear into the background. The innovative American fare excites with bold flavors, as in barbecued oysters sprinkled with pancetta powder. Montauk fluke en croute, set over roasted cauliflower, hazelnuts, and capers topped with a buttery panel of toast, is dressed with sauce proposal-so named because the rich brown butter and golden raisin emulsion is said to have earned the chef a few romantic offers. It is delicious, but Chef Forgione deserves equal affection for those amazing butter-glazed potato rolls.	","[

Guests access atera by an ultra-discreet entrance; from there, a polished and attentive staff member might offer you a complimentary drink before whisking you off to a lovely, U-shaped counter with supple leather seats positioned to watch the kitchen execute its magic. Sound like a beautiful dream? It is wonderfully real, and that's before they ply you with their excellent wine pairing, cocktails or tea tasting (yes, tea-trust us, you'll be talking about it for days). Chef Emborg's Danish-accented menu might begin with an exquisite chilled green tomato soup with juniper oil, before proceeding to a buttery waffle with savory mushroom cream and earthy black truffle. Then, tender snow crab in an ethereal tomato broth with rose hip cream; or sweet scallop with crisp green apple, dill fronds and horseradish ice may be tailed by springy sepia plated with tart currants and laced with a deadly delicious hazelnut fish cream. Plump razor clams in a miso-brown butter broth are topped with bitter greens and foam for added flavor.	","[

It's the perfect space to take a seat at the L-shaped counter, take a deep breath, and let go of that city angst. Then, give yourself over completely to the genius Chef Eiji Ichimura and his talented waitstaff. Throughout your omakase experience, Chef Ichimura always handles the service himself-first bending over his heart-stopping creations and shaping dishes with fingers as nimble as a cellist's, then delivering it with a gracious smile. Dinner might begin with the traditional zensai, or appetizer plate of cold bites; and then move on to dishes like a warm, excellent chawan mushi topped with Florida golden crab, truffle dashi, and confetti of chopped chives. A plate of superbly fresh and seasonal sashimi, some of it expertly cured or carrying a drop of delicious sauce, may be tailed by a mind-blowing parade of bright sushi that might include hiramasa, king mackerel, Japanese ocean trout, Flying fish, sea perch, or the creamiest ebi you've ever tasted, carrying a whisper of shiso and Japanese uni.

The food is worth braving the wait and decibel levels, so sip a craft brew or cocktail before digging in. Start with a plate of wide rice noodles and bits of slow-cooked pork in a coconut-rich yellow curry garnished with herbs, bean sprouts, and slivered banana blossom. Banana leaf-steamed red snapper is another beautifully prepared item, served with crisped artichoke hearts, Chinese broccoli, and more of that sauce. Bright and bitter grapefruit sorbet is a fitting finish.	","[

Bouley,"163 Duane St., New York, NY 10013", French,"Even from the outside, Bouley hints at the certain level of luxury that every successful TriBeCa restaurant strives to attain. Here, it begins with an industrial façade, high arches, exposed brick, and oversized windows dressed in silk. Inside, hand-painted wallpaper, bold watercolors, and a generous floral budget make for an operatic setting reminiscent of a château-maybe the same one from which they salvaged the floors (literally). An undeniable formality keeps the varied clientele muted but never hushed. The ambience may seem a bit old school, yet the cooking mixes tradition with modernity. Meals may start with a fresh, earthy mix of wild mushrooms with sweet garlic, subtle seasoning, and grilled toro that brings unexpected dimension to the dish. Slightly smoky Alaskan salmon with corn sauce and hearts of palm is almost overshadowed by the superlative pomme purée that is buttery yet retains its pronounced potato flavor. But, remember to pace yourself as Bouley pushes one of the most serious carb chariots in town-think death by bread. Finish with an amaretto flan piped with white chocolate, caramelized banana, and silky-smooth maple and amaretto ice cream. It's delicious and never disappoints.	","[

Downstairs, the bi-level space showcases thick steel cables suspending industrial art and a horseshoe bar flanking a large cooking fire that warms the soul and sizzles those lamb chops. The upstairs is more serene. Meals may start with lighter plates of smoky and blistered shishito peppers flecked with crunchy sea salt. Then, move on to deeply satisfying (and reasonably priced) nightly pasta specials, like thick and buttery spaghetti alla Bolognese. ""Landmarc classic"" cheese plates are a reliable highlight. Miniature desserts mean that there is always room for a lemon-custard tart (or four).	","[

Service is eager, efficient, and less concerned with the flow of a leisurely meal. Unlike many Japanese restaurants with one specialty, this izakaya's diverse menu includes bar snacks, sushi, steamed buns, and ramen. Tangy, spicy buffalo cauliflower is a playful take on wings, replacing chicken with bright orange chunks of deep-fried cauliflower tempered by cool, creamy ranch sauce. The Zutto fried rice is another ideal drinking accompaniment, peppered with kimchi and pastrami beneath a runny egg.	","[

Jungsik,"2 Harrison St., New York, NY 10013", Korean,"Cool, chic, and completely urbane, Jungsik is the epitome of contemporary elegance. Inside the large, neatly partitioned space, find rich browns and ivory furnishings with flattering lighting that is just bright enough to see your food clearly. The chairs are deep and tables are well spaced, but request a plush corner banquette for maximum comfort. Even the place settings show sculptural beauty through dark pottery and white porcelain. The ambience is fairly quiet and somewhat reflective. The modern cuisine is confident, complex, and happens to be leaning much more toward Europe than Korea of late. No matter-the cooking remains profoundly enjoyable. At the same time, the most inspired dishes are the ones that retain their heritage, as in the dome of seaweed-seasoned rice with cubes of smoked and torched yellowtail, finished with slivered lettuce. Before the crispy red snapper arrives at the table, hot oil is poured overtop to cook the fish but also to yield incredibly crisped skin, served with a brunoise of hearty greens and potatoes and rich perilla vinaigrette. Artful desserts include black raspberry and coconut sorbet with crumbles of spinach cake, yuzu meringue, and perfect berry slices.	","[

Drew Nieporent's Bâtard restaurant is now firmly in situ and once again we have a talented chef making waves in TriBeCa. Chef Markus Glocker's cooking is very precise and his dishes look quite delicate on the plate. But like a good featherweight they pack more of a punch than you're expecting. You'll even notice his Austrian roots in evidence in some of the dishes, such as short rib and tafelspitz terrine, or the Granny Smith and sweetbread strudel. The room is comfortable and neat and the atmosphere grown-up yet animated. When it comes to service though, it appears that the restaurant has mistaken informality for indifference as it lacks coordination or direction. So you may need to remind yourself that you're here primarily for the food. But that food is very good indeed.	","[

The flavors of wood infuse every element of a thick, blistered pizza decked with potatoes, pancetta, sweet onions, and gently poached eggs. French sensibilities shine in the simply grilled Colorado lamb chops with ribbons of zucchini, baby leeks, and carrots. For dessert, the creamsicle pie bursts with the taste of candied orange, whipped cream, and childhood.	","[

Nom Wah Tea Parlor,"13 Doyers St., New York, NY 10013", Chinese,"Even after a renovation, this ""parlor"" continues to thrive as a retro dive replete with truly awful service. But keep reading, because the supremely delicious food and unreal value more than make up for Nom Wah's many flaws.Dim sum is the main draw at this busy neighborhood diner, where small groups fill the dining counter and pack into pleather booths for the likes of pan-fried dumplings stuffed with ground pork and sweet shrimp. Scallion pancakes flaunt outstanding texture; fried shrimp wrapped in bean curd unites top product with heavenly flavor; and noodles sautéed with superior soy is a salt fiends dream. Bring hungry friends and expect lots of leftovers, because the simple pleasures here have been known to thrill even the most ardent epicurean.	","[

Its textural interplay is as first-rate as the house specialty itself- a crispy fried shrimp-and-scallion roll wrapped in bean curd skin.

Yes, those steaks are on-point, but smoked trout salad followed by 22-ounces of tender and juicy grilled lamb Porterhouse chops never fails to sate. In contrast with the gruff service, a pecan pie studded with chocolate chips and heavy cream is so sweet.	","[

Daruma-ya Soba,"428 Greenwich St., New York, NY 10013", Japanese,"Known for sensational soba and expert execution, Chef Shuichi Kotani crafts his renowned buckwheat noodles every 30 minutes, cooks them in a mere 20 seconds, and offers an experience as authentic as any you'd find in Japan. Cozy up in a round leather booth in the clubby front area, or take a seat in the more elegant wood and stone dining room. To truly understand the elasticity, texture, nutty flavors, and the precision that goes into hand-cutting each strand, go for the purest expression of the complex noodles-served in a simple, delicate dashi with scallions, alongside green vegetables and takuan (Japanese yellow pickled daikon). Also explore small plates like fishcake with shiso and wasabi, sushi offerings, or the fixed dinner menu.	","[

Sushi Azabu,"428 Greenwich St., New York, NY 10013", Japanese,"Like a little secret tucked beneath Daruma-ya, this standout sushi den has a serene look and private feel that is intimacy incarnate. This works out well, since the subterranean room can only seat about a dozen guests. The changing roster of Japanese chefs maintain their mystical composure beneath the dark painting of a carp behind the counter, fostering a relaxed pace to each meal even as orders pile in from upstairs. True, they may be serving the same quality fish as the spot above, but the omakase dishes here are incomparably superior. This is immediately clear from the first bit of otoshi, house-made silken tofu with the bold flavors of sea urchin and salmon roe, finished with bits of crisped nori. The kitchen's seasonal influences may be reflected in a springtime bowl of bamboo shoots braised in smoky dashi, or a delicate cube of steamed Japanese red snapper in soy-ginger broth with grated turnip and a fragrant, bright green cherry leaf. The array of sushi includes an explosively briny giant clam, sea scallop with grated yuzu on perfectly cooked rice, and raw sweet shrimp that is downright knee-weakening. The miso soup is the best you've had in a long time.	","[

Inatteso Pizzabar Casano,"28 West St., New York, NY 10004", Italian,"Manhattan has no shortage of pizza. But shockingly, the touristy, banker-packed Battery Park City lacked a proper wood-fired pizza until the arrival of Inatteso. Tucked away, it features stunning views of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island from the south end of the bar. Any seat in the brightly lit, wood-paneled room provides a glimpse of the oven and scents of a blistering crust. The 12-inch Margherita expresses pure pizza-making skill through soft, fluffy dough with a touch of semolina and knobs of fior di latte. It's not entirely traditional but completely enjoyable. The menu doesn't stop at pizza, and neither should you. Sample pasta like orechiette with broccoli rabe and pan-roasted mahi mahi with sweet and sour eggplant caponata.	","[

This is the sort of place to kick back and enjoy the calm in a bustling city, while sipping from an intelligent, well-priced wine list.

Guests may be torn between the hearty Scotch egg or macrobiotic plate.

When you do find it you enter into a stylish, beautifully understated and meticulously laid out room that wouldn't look out of place in the pages of ""Wallpaper"" magazine. It's run with considerable charm by a discreet and very courteous Japanese team. A lack of headings makes the two-page menu a daunting document so, instead of trying to construct your own meal, you're better off letting the chefs decide by going for the balanced and seasonal dishes of the seven- or nine-course omakase. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the technical skills of the chefs considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative; standouts will be the lingering flavor of Washu beef, perfectly grilled anago, and anything with uni or their homemade tofu. There are tables available but it's so much more satisfying to sit at the counter and engage with the chefs-this way, you may even find that there are a few more dishes in their repertoire than they advertise.

Laab neuh gae sets hand-chopped lamb ablaze with chilies, lime, and mint, whereas tender snails doused in a gently spiced green curry reveal a deep knowledge of nuanced savors. Funky flavors reach full bloom in gaeng som muu krob, crisp pork belly floating in a tart tamarind curry of sausage-stuffed squid, perfectly foiled by sweet lychees. And for a brazen show of taste and texture, tuck into the crispy duck leg (pet palo), served in a soy-anise broth with caramelized tangerine and a soft-cooked egg. Dessert highlights include a coconut sundae accentuated by salty peanuts. And brioche French toast, dunked into condensed milk and caramelized to perfection, is a far cry from its ""milquetoast"" moniker.	","[

Although it may be loud and cramped with the requisite 80's tunes blaring overhead, this adept Italian-American kitchen is bright with classic dishes and a pizza recipe, which as the menu reads, is a 55-year old Staten Island heirloom. The classic pizza balances a cracker-thin crispy crust with tart tomato sauce and oven-browned spots of salty, melting mozzarella. Catch the pasta special like paccheri with subtly sweet and spicy sugo and meaty, tender roasted pork. Night owls may simply snack on the selection of alluring antipasti like mini arancini, but it's worth tasting how efficiently this kitchen can feed the crowds.	","[

Kick things off with a grilled tomato salad, bursting with fresh herbs, salty feta and smoky shishito peppers.

Its décor may have stayed the same through the years-think timeless-but those bar seats remain a hot ticket.

The low, wood-covered ceilings and polished tables provide an intimate setting, while the counter is a prime perch for a solo diner. The staff may point to Americanized options, but it's best to trust the expert chefs and go with an omakase. The menu divides itself into Taiheiyo (""Pacific"") offerings, like the kohada spotted sardine, or a sweet and briny giant clam; and Taiseiyo (""Atlantic""), perhaps featuring fluke fin or a spicy lobster knuckle.

Founded by Dean & Deluca's Giorgio Deluca, the stylish and distinctly Italian L-shaped room focuses on straightforward pizza, outstanding pastas, and serious desserts. You can't go wrong with the handful of pastas on the menu, such as the lovingly crafted pouches of spinach and ricotta ravioli in a light tomato sauce.

Housed in an old loading dock in SoHo, Public still sports elevated garage doors on its exterior, but the sexy interior is pure style and grace. The décor features unique bronze mailboxes, where box-holders are delivered artisanal wines hand-selected by the chef, and private rooms contoured with billowing fabrics. A first-come, first-serve ""Sunday Supper"" menu is offered every Sunday with limited seating, and almost always sells out. Chef Brad Farmerie's menu is truly innovative-fusion might be an overused descriptor, but it aptly describes his style. Never shy to marry unique items in interesting ways (think smoked paprika oil paired with pea shoots), a sample Farmerie dinner might include house-made ricotta cavatelli tossed in a lovely carrot sauce fashioned like a Bolognese, with pickled ramps, candied sunflower seeds, and a ramp purée; or tender New Zealand venison with pickled beets, hibiscus, currants, and a quinoa-black garlic salad. End on a high with pea-and-crème fraîche ice cream with green matcha, sponge cake, ganache, and lemon tapioca.	","[

Lamb tartare is perfectly balanced, boasting piment d'Espelette-kissed cubes of meat tossed with green chickpeas, strained yogurt, and a slice of excellent toasted bread. Then, exceptionally tender pork loin is served over a mustard-tinged sauce with wilted greens, grilled spring onions, and a delicious bite of deep-fried headcheese.

Chefs Club,"275 Mulberry St., New York, NY 10012", Contemporary,"Like a never-ending All-Star game featuring the country's best dishes, the innovative concept behind Chefs Club (by Food & Wine) is a rotating lineup of the magazine's ""Best New Chefs"" honorees over the years. If that weren't exciting enough, the space itself is visually stunning, featuring a state-of-the-art open kitchen with a striking blue-tile backdrop; a sensational modern bar; and lots of loud music to set the mood. Dinner might include a cool, creamy spring pea soup dotted with pickled pearl onions and fresh herbs; or expertly smoked and seared Hudson Valley foie gras paired with sunchoke purée, apple chips, and buttermilk-thyme jam. Squab à la plancha is then glazed with sage-honey and served over grilled confit leeks with a giblet ragout.	","[

Burger & Barrel,25 W. Houston St. 10012, Gastropub,"Comfort food becomes downright elegant at this urbane gastropub, where clubby leather booths, louvered blinds, and requisite chalked-up blackboards stay on the approachable side of chic. When the long bar and closely set tables are at capacity, conversations bouncing off the wood-paneled walls can reach a dull roar. Still, the atmosphere remains relaxed. The modern pub menu covers all the bases with panache. The griddled Bash burger, slathered with house-made caramelized onion and bacon jam crowned with two crisp onion rings, is a memorable affair. Lighter dishes like a traditional panzanella with chewy-crusty bread cubes and translucent cucumber slices; or chilled sweet-and-tart corn soup with chunks of peekytoe crab are just as satisfying.

Rouge et Blanc,"48 MacDougal St., New York, NY 10012", Contemporary,"The lines between Vietnamese and French cuisines are blurred at Rouge et Blanc, a cozy restaurant with an Indochine-influenced décor. A burlap-covered ceiling, red lacquered chairs, handcrafted pottery, and plants add up to an intimate setting on one of SoHo's quiet side streets. The cuisine avoids common fusion pitfalls to display a balanced approach to cooking, through dishes such as the green papaya salad enlivened with a green curry vinaigrette and crunchy-fried head-on shrimp. Excellent specials include pho ramped up with a lemongrass- and chili oil-laced broth and tender grilled duck breast. Braised beef cheeks showcase classic Vietnamese flavors of cloves, anise, and nuoc cham. A noteworthy selection of French wines complements the delectable menu.	","[

Russ & Daughters Cafe,"127 Orchard St., New York, NY 10002", Deli,"From white-jacketed servers to that pristine counter, this updated yet model LES café channels the very spirit and charm of its mothership, set only blocks away. The adept kitchen follows suit, taking the original, appetizing classics and turning them on their heads to form an array of proper and profoundly flavorful dishes. Regulars perch at the bar to watch the 'tender whip up a cocktail or classic egg cream, while serious diners find a seat and get noshing on hot- and cold-smoked Scottish salmon teamed with potato crisps. The result? A thrilling contrast in flavor and texture. Caramelized chocolate babka French toast is crowned with strawberries for a sweet-savory treat; and ""eggs Benny"" with salmon, spinach, and challah never fails to peg a bruncher.	","[

The Musket Room,"265 Elizabeth St., New York, NY 10012", Contemporary,"The Musket Room is just the restaurant Nolita deserves. Service is incredibly hospitable; and whitewashed walls, raw timber, mortar-smeared brick, and modern Danish chairs fashion a farmhouse-chic interior that's as head-turning as the willowy young locals. To whet their thirst, wine bottles topping a wall-length table in the back dining room are presented and poured with panache. Chef Matt Lambert's forte is the modern cuisine of New Zealand with a contemporary twist. While he may be a Kiwi ambassador, Chef Lambert uses his understanding of very particular ingredients to craft dishes that are seasonal, delicious, and sometimes wildly creative. A rum-cured torchon of foie gras is at once dense yet melting upon contact, accompanied by sweet dates, tart green apple gel, and buttery brioche. Provenance is clearly a high priority in the exceptional Ora king salmon; the bright and supple tranche is topped with freeze-dried Satsuma, citrus oil, and herbs to complement its delicate flavor. For dessert, the superb carrot cake pulls together a spectrum of textures and tastes. However, the stark white, crisp pavlova filled with passion fruit curd, whipped cream, slivered strawberries, and passion fruit pulp is a true classic.	","[

The narrow dining room is loud and cramped, boasting a kitchen that has both its eye on simplicity and an applause-worthy knack for elegant offerings. To that end, Estela's irreverent chef turns out focused, decidedly creative, and (very) small plates. Grilled bread laden with mussels and a tangy aïoli turns into a dazzling bite when paired with pickled carrots, just as beef tartare tossed in chili oil is smartly teamed with sunchoke crisps for sweet and savory hints. And while your greeting upon entry may be less than agreeable, a quivering, bee pollen-crowned panna cotta makes for an utterly perfect goodbye.	","[

Away from artsy SoHo this quiet slice of the neighborhood draws locals looking for an unfussy meal with bright flavors. The small space has exposed brick, two long communal tables, a semi-open kitchen, and carefully chosen music. Detail sets Cómodo apart, beginning with a thick, deep evergreen cilantro soup poured tableside, over a mound of fresh crab, smoky roasted poblano peppers, and tart goat cheese. The interesting and very approachable dishes go on to include lamb sliders on pão de queijo (Brazilian bread made with cheese and cassava) finished with a pop of chipotle cream. Coffee-rubbed slow-roasted pork shoulder shouldn't be missed.	","[

You'll be greeted by a blast of music the second you hit the door, where a long bar leads to a cozy, brick-lined dining space with leather seats. From there, things just take off: along with the clever, urbane menu, an upbeat service staff, and thoughtful wine list brimming with sweet Puglian reds and organic Catalonians, the kitchen delights long before Chef/co-owner Ryan Hardy's renowned pastas hit your plate. Think tender rigatoni with fennel-roasted suckling pig; or perfectly al dente spaghetti alla carbonara piled into a heavenly ball and topped with buttery spring onions, smoked bacon, and a bright yellow duck egg.

Beyond the entrance's neon sign is a small, lamp-lit space with exposed brick and inviting banquettes. At the bar, patrons can sample the forward-thinking fare or fully indulge in an affordable five-course menu. An experimental spirit is clear from the first bite of a warm poppy- and sesame seed-loaf brushed with pork fat and served with sweet-cream butter. Mackerel arrives with blistered skin, tender peas, favas, and charred Padron peppers. Superlative desserts show glimmers of genius, as in the loosely whipped cloud of sunchoke purée with warm toffee caramel and icy apple granita.

A well-stocked bar and bins filled with produce set the mood for enjoyable classics brought to you at the hands of glam servers. Start with jerk chicken that is insanely moist yet nearly black with intense spices, served with Scotch bonnet sauce that will have your mouth tingling for hours. Then cool down with Melvin's ""body good"" salad tossing kale, radish, celery, and apples in a citrus-ginger vinaigrette. From the Jamaican Sampler-think curry coat, oxtail stew, and callaloo-to a boozy rum cake, this Caribbean queen reigns supreme.	","[

Kick things off with anything from the amazing raw bar, where you'll find wildly fresh goodies like creamy oysters bursting with briny flavor.

A pot de fromage sets the tone for the meal. This luscious parmesan custard, served with toast points slathered in anchovy butter, is simple, satisfying with just the right amount of richness. At lunch, a steak sandwich with aged Gruyère and bacon marmalade on a Balthazar-baked brioche bun is a hit.

It's where neighbors can gather for polite conversation over quartinos of Ligurian wine or the massive collection of amari. If it's a lovely place to sit, it's a stellar place to dine.

With soaring arched brick ceilings, exposed brass fixtures, and views of Lafayette Street, this hip hangout exudes a slick downtown sensibility. In fact, the cozy lounge and massive wooden bar are so cool, you may never make it to the dining room-which is fine, because the beautifully composed small plates pack plenty of flavor. Case in point: quail egg and creamy uni atop a tender artichoke on a plate dressed up with dots of oils and shellfish reduction. Lamb tenderloin needs hardly any marinade thanks to the top-quality meat, a rich pink center, and salsa verde; while smoky eggplant balances earthy and sweet with Manchego and balsamic vinegar.	","[

Carbone,"181 Thompson St., New York, NY 10012", Italian,"With nostalgia at the forefront, Carbone is plain gorgeous. While this big, bold, and beautiful ode to Italian-Americana comes alive at night under the low lights, lunch is equally admired among brash bankers with big appetites and Valentino-donning divas. That same sense of history pervades the entire space, which highlights plush banquettes, impressive ceramics, and glittering chandeliers. Was the striking tiled-floor inspired from a certain restaurant scene in The Godfather? Probably. Mid-century classics are what this menu is all about, but exalted ingredients, skill, and presentations will excite even the most cynical savant. Stylish servers-who work the floor with a little flirt and lot of flair-remain in character while presenting top antipasti like crusty garlic bread, soppressata, and fresh, particularly divine olive oil-dunked mozzarella. A Caesar salad tossed tableside with carb-worthy croutons and gently pickled white anchovies hits the ball out of the park, while pale-yellow, ricotta-filled tortellini over an intensely rich and meaty ragù is a laudable delight. Desserts like a proper cheesecake set atop a cookie-crumb base and laced with lemon curd is New York in all its old-school glory.	","[

Witness peas done three ways-mashed, julienned, sliced in their pods, and plated with creamy ricotta, pea broth, and mini parathas; or a glossy, slow-cooked egg served over salty broccolini and shredded Brussels sprouts with a lemony sorrel Hollandaise. Rebecca Eichenbaum's savory-leaning desserts, like a frozen spruce soufflé topped with buttermilk granita and pistachio crumble, are pure bliss.	","[

Carefully selected accents-weathered wood beams, hand-stitched pillows, antique mother-of-pearl napkin rings-bring to life a modern Provençal farmhouse, where rusticity, hospitality and sophistication play in perfect harmony with the culinary arts. Poached shrimp floats in an apple-ginger bath topped with radish, for a cooling yet spicy amuse-bouche to arouse the appetite. This may be followed by delicate fillets of Long Island fluke served over hearts of palm with smoky and earthy shiitake mushrooms. That attention to detail and mouth-filling flavor keeps you engaged, charmed, and absolutely satisfied.	","[

Blue Ribbon Bakery,"35 Downing St., New York, NY 10014", Contemporary,"The origin of this very New York bistro begins with brothers Eric and Bruce Bromberg discovering an abandoned brick oven in the basement of a bodega. This sparked the idea for a bakery, and in 1998 Blue Ribbon Bakery joined the duo's restaurant family. The sunny corner location is an inviting space, from the creaky wood-plank flooring to the heady aroma of freshly baked bread downstairs. Seats at the bar are a hot commodity for solo diners. Opt for a dish that showcases the bakery's bread, such as the beef marrow with bacon bread and onion marmalade, a decadent appetizer that is just the right amount of sweet, salty, tart, and rich. Fried chicken with silky mashed potatoes and the matzoh ball soup both show Blue Ribbon's skill with comforting classics.	","[

L'Apicio,13 E. 1st St. 10003, Italian,"Despite being named for an 18th century Italian cookbook, this buzzy trattoria is a contemporary hit. A downtown vibe courses throughout the swanky den that is slightly rustic and industrial-this setting is worth dressing up for. Half of the room is devoted to the bar, and the private dining room is best suited to exhibitionists who enjoy dining within glass walls in the center of the room. Bright flavors and skilled creativity combine in their tailored selection of Italian plates designed for grazing. Start with dishes like fried green tomatoes capped with sweet basil pesto and milky mozzarella, or fresh agnolotti stuffed with sweetbreads. Finish with a wedge of moist olive oil cake sweetened with crème fraîche and vin santo-soaked raisins.	","[

With its chic urban style, a curated sake- shochu- and whiskey-list, and creative dishes, this authentic haunt draws a food- and drink-focused crowd that's more interested in Japanese sips than pints of beer. Plates are meant to be shared, sashimi are top-notch, and flavors simply impress: a well-seasoned Waygu steak arrives with roasted vegetables and tasty sauces; while a porcelain sea urchin shell, filled with gently scrambled eggs, caviar, and more sea urchin, is as decadent as it sounds. For an exceptional balance between flavor and texture, try the kanpachi dressed with a chiffonade of shiso, myoga, yuzu juice, freshly ground wasabi, and shoyu glaze.	","[

The hardest seats to nab are found downstairs, but the rustic dining room remains as inviting as ever, with tables full of vittles and vino. The kitchen showcases meticulously sourced ingredients that sing the praises of regional Italian know-how, like a mound of arugula, petite mustards, and chrysanthemum greens that top a rather tiny veal Milanese cooked to moist perfection. Thick ribbons of toothsome homemade tagliatelle tossed with myriad mushrooms, melted leeks, and pecorino emits a lovely aroma, befitting this unique and pretty pearl. Meanwhile, the porchetta-served once a year as a sort of sidewalk celebration-is still one of the best in town.	","[

Plunked on prime Lower East Side real estate, the commanding bistro's white-tile exterior, black- and white-tiled floor, and wrought-iron doors invite groups of friends for cocktails and $1 oyster happy hour at the curved bar. While the libations aren't standout, they are a nice complement to tried-and-true classics like braised pork tacos folded with pineapple, tomatillos, pickled red onion, and lime crema with a devilish salsa habanera. A braised brisket patty melt with a decadent blend of pepper jack, mustard, and balsamic onions is as faultless as a tart and refreshing Key lime pie.	","[

High quality fusion dishes may seem more crowd-pleasing than inventive, but are nonetheless delicious.

Beef brisket is slow-braised then griddled, and plated with house-made steak sauce and spicy radish chow-chow.

Minetta Tavern,"113 MacDougal St., New York, NY 10012", Gastropub,"While this 1937 setting has been restored and refreshed, nothing here changes and that is its beauty. This quintessential New York tavern is still surrounded by dark wood, checkerboard tiled floors, and those framed caricatures. The astute service team handles the crowds and energy as well as ever-they even don the same white-aproned livery seen in Mad Men. It's that kind of place. The menu's dedication to bistro classics and New York steakhouse fare ensure its continued longevity. A thick slice of their mosaic-like terrine of oxtail, poached leek, and carrot surrounding a foie gras center is timelessly good. Those warm platters of juicy, tender, appetizingly charred New York strip steaks propped up against a bouquet of peppery watercress shine with simple, perfect flavor. An oval cast-iron pan of slow-cooked pork shank is rendered tender, luscious, and dark as a prune. Piping-hot pommes aligot are just what mashed potatoes were always meant to be: cheesy, creamy, and obscenely decadent. Velvety bittersweet chocolate soufflés and towering wedges of bright white coconut cakes stacked with three layers of pastry cream, tart crème fraîche, and coconut shavings are brazen crowd-pleasers.

Vics,"31 Great Jones St, New York, NY 10012", Italian,"The eatery formerly known as Five Points has been reinvented as an Italian-leaning restaurant complete with exposed brick walls and the requisite red pizza oven. Though the dining room is bright and airy, a notable bar program-especially in Italian inflections such as homemade limoncello-prove there's more to this joint than meets the eye. The best bites are unfussy updates of familiar dishes, such as rye rigatoni with rich braised lamb, fragrant torn oregano, and a sprinkling of sharp cheese. A silky, satisfying nest of cacio e pepe is heavy on the black pepper and nutty pecorino, and that red pizza oven produces thin, crisp pies topped with tomato, basil, and sharp pecorino. For dessert, a bomboloni of ricotta and chocolate is worth the splurge.	","[

Katz's,205 E. Houston St. 10002, Deli,"One of the last-standing, old-time Eastern European spots on the Lower East Side, Katz's is a true NY institution. It's crowded, crazy, and packed with a panoply of characters weirder than a jury duty pool. Tourists, hipsters, blue hairs, and everybody in between flock here, so come on off-hours. Because it's really that good. Walk inside, get a ticket, and don't lose it (those guys at the front aren't hosts-upset their system and you'll get a verbal beating). Then get your food at the counter and bring it to a first-come first-get table; or opt for a slightly less dizzying experience at a waitress-served table. Nothing's changed in the looks or taste. Matzo ball soup, pastrami sandwiches, potato latkes-everything is what you'd expect, only better.	","[

Start with a stroll through the alimentari (located up front) to grab some pickled beans and serious cheeses. Then move on to the rustic dining area upstairs, which oozes warmth and comfort. Note the meticulously conceived copper roof, open kitchen, and other decorative accents that set a picturesque backdrop for a delicious meal. The food here is authoritative and tasty, with a nice representation of Italian cooking from breakfast through dinner. The porchetta panino is timeless, amazing, and vies to be the finest around. Skillfully crafted homemade pasta includes textbook-perfect bucatini cacio e pepe. Finish with an affogato, topping a scoop of vanilla gelato with hot espresso.	","[

An open kitchen is in one room, a pizza oven in another, and a third boasts a wall of window panels that open for alfresco dining. Framed photos and colorful vinyl tablecloths add character. The Neapolitan-style pizza is always a hit, perhaps topped with bright tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and slices of spicy salami. Also savor the likes of fava bean purée with dandelion greens for a thick and homey soup. Garlic bread, baked pasta of the day, and whole eggplant with pepperoncino oil are all flame-kissed creations from the wood-burning oven.

From here, the room unfolds into a series of seductive spaces where one finds a rotisserie oven spinning bronzed birds, a backlit bar with an amber glow, and columns clad in warm honey and blue tile. The cooking is nothing short of stellar, right from that Niçoise salad with thick slices of rare tuna, briny black olives, barely poached green beans, soft potatoes, and hard-boiled egg, to a local fillet of trout finished with mustard sauce and well-dressed frisée salad. Desserts are borderline irresistible, especially the mille-feuille Lafayette with chocolate cremeux and caramel-poached pear.	","[

But, this kitchen is stocked with the best of America's waters. Uni from Maine is beautifully prepared and notable thanks to hay-smoked bonito. Then, expect a live scallop, pearly and sweet, with just a hint of yuzu pepper paste. And, that Florida tiger prawn could not be more fresh or enjoyable as it is knifed and shelled.

Wasan,108 E. 4th St. 10003, Japanese,"The Tokyo-born team of Chef Ryota Kitagawa and Kakusaburo Sakurai both spent time in the kitchen of the Waldorf-Astoria's pioneering Inagiku. Their pedigree is evident in this intimate room, offering excellent food and service. A unique rendition of Japanese cooking includes the house salad of lettuces, radish, seaweed and slivered chayote presented in a delicately crisp, edible bowl made from wheat and corn flour. The ingredients are tossed at the table, resulting in a lovely presentation that's strewn with crisped bits. Delightful house-pickled vegetables include salt-pickled Napa cabbage, sweet-and-sour shavings of watermelon radish, and Brussels sprouts in curry vinegar. And with its foundation of hijiki seaweed rice, the lush unagi bowl is a treat.	","[

Pagani,"289 Bleecker St., New York, NY 10014", Italian,"With witty cocktails, cured meats, and rustico nuovo décor, Pagani brings an extra dose of Italian charm to Bleecker Street, and a good one at that. Flauting a vibrant scene of locals guzzling indigenous Italian wines and Averna-steeped drinks, this brainchild of Massimo Lusardi targets a younger brood where authenticity and creativity go hand-in-hand. His family may own several other restaurants, but sizeable portions of house-made pasta with updated embellishments (think: montasio cheese topping a decadent ragù of veal and pork) highlight balance and excellence. Just as veal shoulder arrives unbelievably fragrant and tender with herb-rubbed, toasted bread; rigatoni with braised rabbit and sweet carrots feel like a match made in culinary heaven.	","[

The Little Owl,"90 Bedford St., New York, NY 10014", American,"Perched on a winsome corner of the West Village, Chef Joey Campanaro's The Little Owl continues to hold a dear place in the hearts of diners near and far who appreciate that simple food and great food can be one and the same. The broccoli soup (a pure, silky purée enriched with a trace of cream and crowned by a crouton of bubbling, aged cheddar) is among the best examples of this. The small corner room is quaint and despite this establishment's popularity, the service team is completely attitude-free. The wee kitchen is on display, and the focused crew turns out a rousing roster of preparations that may bear an affinity for Mediterranean cuisine such as seared cod with bagna cauda vinaigrette, and gravy meatball sliders, a hands-down house specialty.

Seats up front offer prime views of an action-packed kitchen, while the back is best for intimacy and more sips from the impressive list. Fresh, thinly sliced squid quickly tossed in garlic, olive oil, lemon, parsley, and chili flakes is a study in the powers of simplicity; while strozzapretti with ""Dad's Sunday Marinara Sauce"" is an elevated rendition of the classic-finished with a mound of luscious ricotta. Even the plainest of pastas are enviably enriched here-imagine twirls of spaghetti al limone with a mountain of parmesan and black pepper. If you can save room, the tiramisu is light, fluffy, and molto buono!	","[

The overall effect is warmer than a Malibu sunset.

Beets take a turn in the rotisserie oven and arrive for your pleasure as a warm salad with hearty bulgur, pickled cucumber, and a pool of horseradish cream.

Jewel Bako,239 E. 5th St. 10003, Japanese,"Black walls surrounding two tiny windows form the façade of this surreptitious gem. Unlike the diverse neighborhood in which it resides, the décor inside the long room is simple and sleek, framed by low ceilings, curving bamboo slats, and close-knit tables. Servers are smartly attired if a little too-cool-for-school, but the passionate chefs here provide a wealth of culinary entertainment. This is a place where painstaking detail is evident from start to finish. A large square plate, for instance, may feature the likes of ruby-red tuna set beside soy-mirin sauce; an edible cup filled with a spicy salmon mixture; densely packed roe topped with bonito flakes; and a peppery watercress salad. Then, a thick cut of salmon marinated in three types of miso and cooked en papillote is unwrapped to reveal the most tender, moist, and flaky meat. And finally, each grain of slightly sticky rice in the sushi omakase is cooked perfectly and combined with fluke, Tasmanian trout, and creamy otoro. Young couples as well as die-hard downtowners idolize this ""jewel"" and for good reason-a dessert of green tea ice cream sandwiched between chocolate chip cookies is exemplary, delicious, and very, very special.

A little bit country and a little bit food lab, this brunch-focused bijou has achieved such success in NY that the owners now have outposts in Japan and Dubai. Service can struggle to keep up with the crowds, but the loud and lively dining room doesn't seem to notice. Breakfast for dinner is always a treat, especially when golden brown Belgian waffles are served with warm maple butter and topped with buttermilk-brined fried chicken for a flawless marriage of sweet and savory. Lighter but still lovely, chicken tortilla soup sees a pile of crunchy fried tortilla strips over hearty broth bobbing with carrots, celery, and shredded chicken.	","[

The subdued lighting, plush banquettes, and cream-colored walls lend a calm vibe despite the clubby music.

Instagrammable dishes take their cue from French classics and may feature crusty olive oil-drizzled country bread slathered with fluffy scrambled eggs, salty prosciutto, and nutty parmesan. Then await croissants-fresh, buttery, and flaky-served with sweet fruit preserves for a typically French and very decadent treat.

Soto,"357 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10014", Japanese,"Culinary dominance, unmistakable skill, and absolute discipline permeate every angle of this modest storefront. This is not some flashy temple to sushi, but rather an authentic and visually restrained rendering of a traditional Japanese restaurant. If the sterile look (with just blonde wood and bright lights to embellish) seems too antiseptic, then remember that Soto prides itself on precise preparations of luxurious raw seafood. While operational issues combined with lackluster service may have impacted guests' experiences of late, the cuisine of Chef Sotohiro Kosugi remains extraordinary-as long as you can tune out the flaws. Knife skills are paramount and every element is at its precise temperature, as these adept cooks coax each morsel of impossibly rich uni, served simply with uni powder, into a single bite that leaves a lasting impression. Composed dishes are not only strikingly beautiful, but an outright hit-imagine finely chopped and exceedingly silken toro tartare with avocado coulis, caviar, and chives accompanied by a sesame-ponzu sauce. And, unctuous fresh water eel combined with Tosa vinegar, smoky bonito flakes, and crisp Japanese cucumbers come together to form a neat but umami-rich finish.	","[

The Asian element of the fusion equation is quite pronounced yet there is also plenty of choice for those who prefer their influences to come from more Westerly cuisines. As a result, one can start with black sea bass sashimi with trout roe and follow it up, by way of contrast, with a ""tasting of lamb"" with cauliflower. Dishes are quite delicate creations and come with some flavor combinations that will certainly perk up your taste buds. The dining room exudes warmth; the service is self-assured and, given that annisa means ""women"" in Arabic, it is fitting that the wine list makes a point of featuring many female wine growers.	","[

Everything on the menu is sourced from the Stone Barns Center (home to Blue Hill's Westchester farm) as well as a number of local producers. Blue Hill's intimate space has been hosting a devoted foodie following for an impressive 15-some years, and service in this former speakeasy-where fresh flowers and candlelight cast a romantic spell-is nothing less than excellent. The adept kitchen turns out contemporary cuisine, which in turn showcases the astounding quality stocked in the larder and allows vegetables to shine at all times. Asparagus spears are gently roasted to preserve their natural earthiness and coupled with vibrant beet yogurt as well as stinging nettles cream for a perfect balance in flavor. Then, moist striped bass draped atop fennel purée is decked with soft, sweet currants and toasted salty pine nuts to form a succulent and satisfying entrée. Familiar desserts highlight still more of the kitchen's best, as is the case with light and custard-y brioche bread pudding coupled with a quenelle of pleasantly bitter cocoa nib cream.	","[

The food itself is always artful and precise, and the menu more than delivers on its promise: creative, rustic Italian fare made with stellar skill and extraordinary ingredients. Mainstays like a delicate lamb's tongue vinaigrette arrives humming with tender beech mushrooms and topped with a 3-minute egg and mâche; while soft beef cheek ravioli bathed in a Castelmagno cheese- and black truffle-reduction is subtle but wow-inducing.

Mighty Quinn's,"103 2nd Ave., New York, NY 10003", Barbecue,"From its humble beginnings as a Smorgasburg favorite, Mighty Quinn's continues to impress with its ""low and slow smoked barbecue."" And, boasting permanent outposts at the Hudson Eats FiDi food hall and West Village, this rustic and casual wood-lined space feels young and energetic with crowds of hungry diners lined up to the door. Cafeteria-like service features cleaver-wielding cooks proffering pulled pork, ribs, and more. Selections are sliced, weighed, and piled high before you even make it to the sides and vats of house pickles. Go for the baked beans, made with black-eyed peas and meaty burnt ends for plenty of umami. The best reason to come here may be the wonderfully wobbly-tender brisket, pink-tinged with smoke and thinly crusted in spice.	","[

I Sodi,"105 Christopher St., New York, NY 10014", Italian,"Manhattan has classic Italian and new Italian, but not many thoughtful Italian restaurants. Tuscan native Rita Sodi is out to change that with this trattoria. She consciously selected every aspect of the design, from the heavy linen napkins to the thick, striated glass windows that hide the modern space from the marauding groups of young people on Bleecker. Inside this oasis, Negronis prep palates for al dente rigatoni and hearty, meat-focused dishes like the coniglio in porchetta. This exceptional rabbit preparation combines bacon-wrapped loin with a sweet wine- rosemary- and garlic-sauce. The herbal quality of such savoriness brings out the almost austere nature of the lean rabbit, showing how truly intuitive and innovative Italian cooking can be.	","[

Whitewashed brick walls, chili-red beams, an orange accent wall, and ebony furnishings detail the tidy space. Steer clear of the Chinese-American portion of the menu; instead, partake in the memorable house specialties featuring dried chilies, Sichuan peppercorns, and pickled peppers that singe with abandon. However, a handful of straightforward items do bring relief from the spicy onslaught, as in minced pork with pickled cabbage in a light, sour broth; chunks of dark and salty-sweet braised beef and potatoes; and myriad hotpots (a recent menu addition).

The clean, narrow space is bright and contemporary, with black tile walls and copper pots hanging from exposed brick. From the kitchen, tangra-style Calcutta-Chinese specialties are a new offering, however it is best to focus your attention on the preparations originating from the Southwest coast.

Stir-fried and slow-cooked specialties are sought after here, as in the black pork curry featuring an ink-dark sauce of roasted spices, chilies, black pepper, ginger, and cloves.

If the unusual menu and bland interior have you second-guessing yourself, have faith as the food will put those fears to rest soon enough.

The Eddy's menu defies easy categorization and offers cleverly constructed cooking. Fried beef tendons are a puffed and crunchy snack dabbed with charred onion cream and sweet trout roe. Delicate ricotta gnocchi with toasted hazelnuts showcases spring's sweet peas and pickled ramps, while golden spotted tile fish is seared and plated with squid ink Hollandaise, saffron broth, rice beans, and braised artichokes.

You might even adopt a drawl while reading through Root & Bone's pleasing menu. Grandma Daisy's warm angel biscuits are incredibly light and fluffy-especially alongside that salty-sweet, dark chicken-maple jus for dipping. The signature sweet tea-brined fried chicken is prepared in a designated corner of the room, filling the space with tempting aromas. Shrimp and grits with Virginia country ham has a Yankee touch thanks to the addition of Brooklyn lager to the sauce.	","[

A semi-open kitchen, polished and gleaming with stainless steel, pushes out wickedly good Italian dishes like tender potato gnocchi in a rabbit cacciatore, laced with garlic, sweet tomato, rosemary and sage; or perfectly charred octopus paired with creamy potatoes spiked with chilies, olives and savory pancetta.

Even humble Brussels sprouts get special treatment with a kick of sriracha. Finish it all off with monkey bread made with eggy-buttery brioche and a brilliantly subtle hint of maple.	","[

It's worth any hassle, though, when you sit down to experience the farm-to-table, Asian-fusion concept from big names in the business like Joe Ng & Ed Schoenfeld. The freewheeling kitchen relishes experimenting with local ingredients. Try the bright green pea-leaf and shrimp dumplings, which stand out beautifully in their near-translucent casing; or wok-fried Dungeness crab and crawfish in a thick and spicy basil-ginger sauce.

Upon entering Somtum Der, a cozy enclave stylishly accented with bright pops of red, diners are greeted by a glimpse of the kitchen and its somtum station. There, contents from the large glass jars of nuts, dried red chilies, and spices are ground in a mortar and pestle to produce its eponymous dish-also referred to as the city's best green papaya salad(s). Order big here, as the portions aren't massive and the food is plain terrific. The kitchen is happy to kick things up a notch spice-wise, so be aggressive and request the hotter end of the spectrum for greater authenticity. The service staff here is both friendly and hospitable, so heed their advice and include in every meal an addictive skewer of Der's-style grilled sticky rice to go along with the likes of lip-smacking larb tod. Other highlights have included succulent deep-fried chicken thighs sprinkled with toasted garlic chips and accompanied by a pungent citrus-and-spice dipping sauce. Smoky-sweet moo ping kati sod-marinated, grilled, and coconut-glazed pork set over cool rice vermicelli-is gloriously succulent and particularly addictive.	","[

The height of professionalism and hospitality, the staff is not merely attentive but appreciative of your presence at their table-or perhaps at one of the prized chef's counter stools for kaiseki dining, where mesmerizing craft is exhibited.

The sashimi of the day may feature a fresh oyster with sautéed onion and yuzu kosho oroshi swimming in ponzu; simmered firefly squid and celery topped with salty karashi-miso and pickled plum; or tender raw octopus. Clay pots reveal fragrant dashi cooked with woodear mushooms, carrots, turnips, and bobbing with a tiny melting ball of excellent mozzarella as well as the quenelle-like shrimp dumpling, ebishinjo.

Tuome,536 E. 5th St. 10009, Fusion,"Chef Thomas Chen's intimate venue flaunts petite East Village bones, a warm glow cast over the hip crowd, and a too-loud playlist that may cause indigestion for anyone older than a Millenial. Asian accents filtered through the mind of this chef (who spent time behind the line at Eleven Madison Park) reveal a playful lineup. Treviso spears are brushed with creamy Caesar dressing and plated with warm, buttery croutons, clementine segments, and toasted sunflower seeds. Black bass is expertly seared and sauced with New England-style clam chowder pocked with Chinese sausage and perfectly complemented by a side of banana leaf-wrapped sticky rice enriched with duck fat. If you still have room for dessert, order the hot, crisp, and mildly sweet Chinese beignets.	","[

Hasaki,210 E. 9th St. 10003, Japanese,"Since the mid-eighties, this local darling has been going strong thanks to its high quality ingredients, skilled kitchen, and excellent value. For under $20, the soba lunch set will warm the heart of any frugal fan of Japanese cuisine. This generous feast features a bowl of green tea noodles in hot, crystal-clear dashi stocked with wilted water spinach and fish cake, accompanied by lean tuna chirashi, yellowtail, and kanpyo. The ten-don, a jumbo shrimp tempura served over rice, is just as enticing. The à la carte offerings draw crowds seeking delish sushi as well as a host of tasty cooked preparations; a Twilight menu is nice for early birds. The dining room has a clean and spare look, with seating available at a number of wood tables or sizable counter.	","[

Fedora,239 W. 4th St. 10014, Contemporary,"An ode to the New York old guard, Fedora still attracts the creative, the moneyed and the young. It's a sort of dreamlike supper club where well-crafted cocktails flow into endless conversations, the words absorbed into the crevices of the original carved wooden bar as they have for generations. No longer a renowned literati haunt, Fedora remains an attractive homage to the Village of yore. Tuck your bag and coat into the cubby above the banquette and set off on an adventure in contemporary cuisine, one that mixes barbecue cream with smoked salmon and highlights the distinctive wines of Jura. This builds to the excellent and gargantuan crispy duck with perfectly lacquered skin accented by a date-barbecue sauce that's pure hedonistic inspiration.	","[

Oiji,"119 1st Ave., New York, NY 10003", Korean,"Headed by a duo of young Korean-born chefs who met at the Culinary Institute of America and put their education to work in the stellar kitchens of Bouley and Gramercy Tavern, Oiji dishes out an updated take on Korean flavors. The intimate dining room is small and moodily lit, with an open kitchen that allows diners to see and hear the action as it takes place. Polished and refined yet familiar, the concise menu of small plates offers an appealing approach. Decadently rich and creamy, the wild sesame soup-a dairy-free sensation-is poured over wild mushrooms, chewy rice cake, and black truffle. Pine smoke-infused mackerel is served with a wedge of lemon and yuzu-soy sauce to brighten the fragrant and oily-rich fish. Of course, the kimchi is not to be missed.	","[

Located on an irresistibly cute corner with large windows, Mary's Fish Camp tempts with creative daily specials scrawled on a chalkboard, sweet and briny raw offerings, and nostalgic desserts like hot fudge sundaes. Crowds pack into the curving stainless steel counter while white, lazy fans spin overhead. The summery space offers lots of choice, but the lobster roll should not be overlooked. A toasted bun is overflowing with hunks of tender, sweet meat dressed in the perfect proportion of mayonnaise and lemon juice, with a mountain of shoestring fries on the side. Begin the meal with spicy Key West conch chowder and then end with a slice of Americana-banana cream pie.	","[

Taking its name from the Greek translation of ""made from clay,"" this contemporary taverna features a ceiling canopy of suspended terra-cotta pots dressing up a room with whitewashed walls and lapis-blue insets. Pale-green stemware and stark white crockery are used to serve Greek wines and a menu of rustic home-style cooking. Gigantes are baked in honey-scented tomato-dill sauce; grilled marinated octopus is drizzled with balsamic reduction; and anginares moussaka is a creamy vegetarian take on the classic made with artichokes.

Lavagna,545 E. 5th St. 10009, Italian,"The little menu at this neighborhood fixture proves that quality trumps size. Lavagna's kitchen is snug but still manages to make ample use of a wood-burning oven to bake everything from delicate pizette to whole roasted fish. Pastas are always a treat, while other tasty options can include pan-fried smoked scamorza paired with a roasted red pepper crostini, juicy rack of lamb, or a slice of spot-on crostata filled with seasonal fruit and dressed with caramel sauce. Framed mirrors, a pressed-tin ceiling, and candlelight produce a mood that is almost as warm as the genuinely gracious service, which ensures that regulars receive the royal treatment. That said, everyone who steps through these doors feels welcome and well taken care of.	","[

That country's proximity to Russia, Turkey, and Armenia results in a vibrant and enticingly diverse cuisine that Oda House does proud. A liberal use of fragrant spices, cheese-filled breads, kebabs, and slow-cooked meats typify the kitchen's preparations. Classic dishes include satsivi, boiled chicken served cool in a creamy walnut sauce seasoned with warm spices, accompanied by gomi, hominy grits in a mini cauldron studded with morsels of rich, stretchy sulgani cheese.

Bigeye tuna poke strewn with seaweed, diced macadamia nuts, and pickled jalapeños is just one of the delicious highlights on offer, while plump shrimp seasoned with crushed garlic and arranged over a bed of sticky rice and baby romaine is another fine choice. For dessert, the signature take on bread pudding boasts caramelized slices of custard-soaked King's Hawaiian bread with rum raisins and a knockout scoop of pineapple ice cream.	","[

Left Bank,"117 Perry St., New York, NY 10014", Contemporary,"Left Bank may have plenty of local competition, but few have the attentive and considerate service combined with such a lively bar scene. With its faux-farmhouse décor and rather bucolic corner location, it is a go-to neighborhood haunt. Happy hour specials bring them in, but the bar bites make them stay. Every dish on the menu is pleasing, from the buttery lobster puffs perched on champagne cream to the perfectly crafted Mongolian dumplings, full of spicy lamb, cabbage, and onion with a cool soy-lime dipping sauce. The lovely farfalle with fresh favas, sunchoke, spring onion, and chili is bound by a sprinkling of nutty Parmigiano. Top it off with deliciously simple desserts, like a wedge of ricotta cheesecake and a properly poached Bosc pear.	","[

Sevilla,"62 Charles St., New York, NY 10014", Spanish,"Yellowed menus that haven't changed in decades make this old-school Spanish stalwart seem like a relic. Still, no one comes here to be surprised. Rather, they are plowing through their favorite renditions of paella, ranging from vegetable to seafood with chicken and chorizo. The paella Valenciana also adds clams, mussels, and lobster claws. Prices are low, portions are large, and lively crowds are always happy. Dishes are made to order, so if that arroz con pollo takes 30 minutes to get to your table, know that it will be worthy of the wait. It arrives as a massive amount of saffron-tinged rice and tender bone-in chicken dotted with green onions, pepper strips, lots of garlic, chorizo, and peas. Come dessert, you cannot go wrong with the flan.	","[

Spasso,"551 Hudson St., New York, NY 10014", Italian,"The quaint far West Village has no dearth of Italian restaurants, and Spasso distinguishes itself not only with its ornate, white wood-framed windows, but an inviting ambience and stellar service. It's the friendly corner spot with a marble bar where you can sip a glass of Nebbiolo and chat with the chefs, or simply dine solo on bowls of fresh pasta. The bells and whistles are here with squid ink spaghettini with mosciame or air-dried tuna (a specialty of Sardinia); and tripe ragù over tagliatelle. But creative dishes, like giardiniera-laced beef tartare also star, as a tangy twist on the traditional. Speaking of twists, affogato offers quite the kick with ice cream that is ""choked"" with sherry, amaro, or rye whiskey and then drizzled with a shot of espresso.	","[

Aim straight for the counter to appreciate the theatrics of it all, where orders are acknowledged with more shouts flying from Japanese servers to chefs.

Appropriate for this locale, the setting eschews the standard men's club swagger of most steakhouses for a look that's spare and cool. Despite the chillax vibe, expect to see suits; the meat is that good. In fact, it's procured from the same purveyor that supplies Peter Luger and Keens. Aged in-house for six weeks, the USDA Prime Porterhouse is presented hot off the grill but well rested, richly flavored, tender, and juicy. Myriad cuts satisfy all preferences, while sides like kimchi, spicy scallion salad, and fermented cabbage stew are especially appealing and honor the owners' heritage. Heartwarming Korean-style soups and stews are wonderful wintertime favorites.	","[

Wallsé,344 W. 11th St. 10014, Austrian,"There are some foods that just feel right at certain times of the year. When the nights draw in and there's a little chill in the air, there are certain words whose very presence on a menu summon feelings of comfort and warmth-and those words surely include spaetzle, schnitzel, and strudel. Austrian cuisine is known for being hearty and immeasurably satisfying, but the great strength of Wallsé is that you don't have to have spent the day skiing in Innsbruck to appreciate its cuisine because the adept kitchen has a lightness of touch and is not rigidly tied to tradition. Whether you've chosen the loin of venison with bone marrow or have gone for the tafelspitz, you'll find the dishes are nicely balanced and effortlessly easy to eat. The restaurant is divided into two rooms, both dominated by striking paintings, some of which are of the chef himself. The clientele is a largely sophisticated bunch with an inherent understanding of how restaurants work which, in turn, creates an easy, relaxing atmosphere. The wine list also merits examination, if only to discover there's more to Austrian wine than Grüner Veltliner.	","[

Spotted Pig,314 W. 11th St. 10014, Gastropub,"It's impossible to tell if the famously talented April Bloomfield ever imagined the celebrity draw her restaurant would have over the likes of, say, Kanye West (who reputedly tweeted a drinks invite here to his followers). But many years ago, when Spotted Pig sashayed its way onto an adorable corner of the West Village, New York City was more than ready to meet-and fall completely in love with-the gastropub. But as popular as the restaurant (and now the gastropub trend itself) has grown, Bloomfield's cooking has always been the real draw. And, it doesn't matter if you are teetering on a wooden stool, knocking elbows with pencil-thin hipsters all night in this cozy, bi-level space. With food like this, you might as well be on the moon. Bloomfield has made her name on those outstanding burgers, pan-seared mackerel, and legendary gnudi (feather-light orbs of ricotta ""gnocchi"" laced with brown butter, crispy sage, and nutty parmesan) but you really can't miss on this menu. Kick things off with a small plate of fresh, creamy burrata and grilled sourdough, spread with fava, mint, and a few chili flakes; and then move on to a perfectly roasted poussin, served with Sherry vinegar, grilled ramps, and delicate spring onions.

Kajitsu,125 E. 39th St. 10016, Japanese,"It's the way of the modern world that we think of the changing of the seasons more in terms of our wardrobe rather than our food-but a meal at Kajitsu could change that. This Japanese vegan restaurant serves shojin cuisine based on the precepts of Buddhism-if you're in search of an antidote to the plethora of steakhouses in the city, this is it. The second floor, traditionally decorated space is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility and offers table or counter seating and service that is as charming as it is earnest. Such is the skill of the kitchen you'll forget in no time about the absence of fish or meat. It's all about balance, harmony and simplicity-and allowing the ingredients' natural flavors to shine, whether it's the delicate onion soup with mizuna and potato, or the visually arresting hassun which could include everything from mountain yam to burdock root. Your period of contemplation and newfound respect for your fellow man may come to a juddering halt when you find yourself back on Lexington but, for a few moments at least, you'll feel you connected with nature.

Rai Rai Ken,218 E. 10th St. 10003, Japanese,"Rai Rai Ken isn't quite what it used to be-it's bigger and much more comfortable. Just a few doors east of its former location, this room boasts a fresh and tidy look with blonde wood seating plus signature red vinyl stools. An array of pots remain bubbling and steaming behind the counter. Rest assured the menu's star attraction-those thin and toothsome ramen noodles-are just as delicious, served with four near-addictive, fantastically complex broth variations: shio, shoyu, miso, and curry. Each bowlful is chock-full of garnishes, like slices of roasted pork, boiled egg, nori, fishcake, and a nest of springy noodles.

Curry-Ya,214 E. 10th St. 10003, Japanese,"Complex, warming, and perfumed with fruity sweetness, slow-cooked wafuu (or Japanese-style) curry is a highly popular national treat. Tantalizingly draped over a mound of steamed short grain rice, each bowl calls for one of the kitchen's tasty embellishments such as panko-crusted fried shrimp, pan-fried hamburger steak, Berkshire pork, or chicken katsu. The brief menu also offers inspiring starters like flavor-packed tofu skin and green bean salad tossed with parmesan and a crushed-olive dressing. Brought to you by Bon Yagi (also of Rai Rai Ken, a few doors away), this local jewel has 14-seats along a white marble counter lined with bowls of pickles and dried onion flakes. The space may seem simple but it's a spectacular destination to dig in and enjoy.	","[

Cagen,414 E. 9th St. 10009, Japanese,"Boasting soothing textured walls the color of sand, sturdy but comfortable furnishings, and cool slate flooring, thisserene and serious space is just what one would expect of a high-end Japanese dining room. But, beyond this quotidian look is a kitchen that turns out very exciting-and quite unexpected-food. Tables are an available option, but a seat facing Chef Toshio Tomita at the pristine elm counteris the place to be. While the menu offers both à la carte dining and a sushionly omakase, the Chef's Counter omakase is by far the best experience to be had here. This meal begins with a playful platter of bites (envision smoked ham katsu) to break the ice and stimulate the palate for the kitchen's sparkling sashimi. Slices of Hokkaido octopus, marinated bonito, and snapper are a treat, dressed not only with freshly ground wasabi root and top-notch soy sauce, but also the chef's signature chimichurri-a touch of fusion that signals his decade-plus years of working at Nobu. Another highlight is the chilled handmade soba served with spicy buckwheat sprouts and a divine dipping sauce. Cooked dishes, like fried soft-shell crab with watermelon salad, and impressive nigiri round out Cagen's kappo-style meal.	","[

Dressed with tightly-packed square communal tables and beaded ceiling lights, petite Graffiti may be dimly lit, but an exposed brick wall glossed with a metallic finish and hugging framed mirrors is all brightness.

Springy ramen clutching spicy lamb Bolognese is a perfect example of this flavorful union. The tiny step-down setting is easy to miss but conquers its spatial challenge with comfortable seats. Find foodies centered around a dining counter that juts out from the kitchen-a handful of small tables also bolster the accommodations. A unique array of small plates includes buffalo mozzarella with uni and yuzu foam, and steamed buns filled with Berkshire pork belly. Meanwhile, entrées go on to include miso-glazed cod set atop an appealing wild mushroom risotto fortified by a poached egg. Desserts are equally impressive, as in a silky Earl Grey crème brûlée.	","[

Inside, find towering floral arrangements and lofty ceilings hung with massive fabric-draped fixtures, which soften the room's appearance. The interior is vast, but the sunken dining area, elevated bar, and smartly divided room feel more classic than overdone. The service team exemplifies on-the-ball excellence. This kitchen's distinctive American seasonal cooking is in clear balance from start to finish. Begin with the simple-sounding tuna tartare combining chopped yellowfin and shiso surrounded by Japanese cucumber, enlivened with miso-ginger vinaigrette. Move on to explore seasonal risotto, showcasing wintery mushrooms or perhaps a summery feast of sweet shrimp, chives, and touch of tomato. Batter-fried soft-shell crabs are a feat of technical perfection, with body and crisped legs set over sautéed vegetables and a light citrus-soy reduction. Desserts alone are worth a visit, especially to indulge in the famously dense chocolate cake, served warm with a scoop of luscious salted-almond ice cream and cracked cocoa nibs. The ""greenmarket"" prix-fixe lunch offers great value and quality.	","[

Every seat is filled nightly, surrounding the large team at work. Soft lighting highlights the texture of exposed brick walls to moody effect, and a thumping playlist says downtown-albeit too loudly. A sushi tasting and sushi kaiseki are the only options offered yet diners will not be left wanting. While the latter is a fuller experience working in an abundance of flavors like pan-seared squab breast, the tasting is a slightly streamlined and more rewarding choice. Regardless of your decision, a morsel of toothsome house-made mochi, dabbed with toasty pistachio miso, is a delightfully enticing opener.	","[

Momofuku Ko,"8 Extra Pl., New York, NY 10003", Contemporary,"David Chang's beloved Ko has packed up its 600-square-foot tasting course concept and moved a few blocks south. Down a quiet alley and behind a door sporting his proverbial peach, you'll find the handsome new digs: a street-hip space sporting 40 seats, 22 of them surrounding the open kitchen via a U-shaped counter made of smooth black walnut. Much else remains the same. Per the old rules, there is no à la carte-only the multicourse menu for the evening (which you're given in print before you go). Then, dishes are delivered by the chefs themselves, who briefly describe each ingredient; while servers slip seamlessly between guests, changing silver and filling drinks. Chang is a veritable rock star chef by any standard (and his longtime lieutenant Sean Gray is the chef's equivalent of Keith Richards), so you're in expert hands from the start. Fresh, sweet sea bream is bound by translucent grated yam with fragrant shiso and pops of finger lime; and tender beef tartare is paired with cream of oyster as well as crushed popcorn. Delicate kabocha squash tortellini arrives with shaved parmesan and agrodolce; and a perfectly seared slice of venison is paired with silky potatoes and earthy Époisses.	","[

Come dessert, go for a simple and outrageously good plate of biscotti, served in a ""jenga"" arrangement of bittersweet chocolate and walnut or pistachio and anise flavors.	","[

Banquettes line one side of the restaurant, suggesting cozy evenings of sharing coca de atùn (flatbread pizza) or pan tomate.Empanadas are flaky and crusty, filled with thyme-laced beef, spring onion, allspice, and cheese. Classic croquetas are crackling outside and creamy within, resting on a dab of aïoli. But such snacks are just a prelude to the excellent paella; choose one version studded with shellfish and sweet peppers, or mix and match two or three different ""flavors.""

Motorino,349 E. 12th St. 10003, Pizza,"What started out as a Neapolitan-style pizzeria in Brooklyn has grown into a global chain with locations in Hong Kong and Manila. Cloaked in the scent of wood-fired pies, Motorino is praised as an all-day spot that's easy on the wallet. True, it may be smaller than the newer, slightly grander Williamsburg outpost, but these pizzas leave nothing to be desired. Blackboard specials convey the product-focused sensibilities that begin with a lunchtime prix-fixe pairing a green salad of mint, beet greens, and red onion in balsamic vinaigrette with a perfectly charred and chewy pie. The foundation of each pizza is its outstanding crust spread with crushed tomatoes, gobs of melting fresh mozzarella, and perhaps a generous layering of spicy sausage slices.	","[

Blenheim,283 W. 12th St. 10014, American,"When a restaurant sources ingredients from its own farm in the Catskills, it clearly takes its farm-to-table ethos to heart. Even the décor here at Blenheim reflects this philosophy by way of distressed wood paneling and a style that is far more country-cool than precious. Service is eager and just as committed to the chef's mission of presenting pure ingredients with progressive elegance. There may be no more genuine expression of this kitchen than the farm eggs, their yolk bright orange and fresh, set beside gently charred slices of hangar steak and fork-tender fingerlings. Silky foie gras torchon is finished tableside with refreshing tomato water; and dense, creamy quadrello di bufala with pistachio sable is a welcome stand-in for an arid bread pudding.	","[

It's a fun, convivial ambience, no question-but the star of the show here is indisputably Chang's singular Korean and Japanese cooking style, which flirts with European and Californian influences. There's perfectly sourced charcuterie and a lovely raw bar to kick things off, but don't leave without moving on to Chang's legendary pork buns-pillow-soft and laced with hoisin sauce, cucumber, and scallions.

An array of small bites makes up Donostia's menu. Find Spanish cheeses and charcuteria of Iberico pork, but the true star here are the conservas.

Springtime lunches with garage doors open to the sidewalk, and a feast of refined, simple dishes have earned Jonathan Waxman a devoted following in a neighborhood already full of charming restaurants. Casually professional service and the dimly lit dining room's dose of California cool enhance the experience. Barbuto's roast chicken deserves its legendary status, but other dishes tempt too. A cavolo nero salad of thinly sliced black kale and crunchy breadcrumbs tossed in a creamy dressing of anchovies and pecorino puts the average kale salad to shame. Linguini is coated with black pepper, egg, pancetta, and cheese in one indelible plate of carbonara.	","[

The signature gnocco (sweet, salty pillows of fried bread) can be ordered as an appetizer, side, or even as a dessert with Nutella. Pizzas shine on this carb-centric menu, thanks to that blistered thin crust hanging over the plate's edge. The Amatriciana layers tart tomato sauce with sweet red onion, shreds of pancetta, and a heavy-handed sprinkle of red pepper flakes. The torta cioccolato with chocolate mousse makes a fine dessert.

Santina,"820 Washington St., New York, NY 10014", Seafood,"When life feels too monochrome, there is now a cure and its name is Santina. This Meatpacking hot spot, courtesy of Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi, and Jeff Zalaznick, is simply awash with color. From the waitstaff's polo shirts to the vivid, vibrant food, and even the bowls in which it's served, this kaleidoscope of sunny, southern European colors will simply make you feel better about life. It all happens in a glass box under the High Line designed by Renzo Piano-and Carmen Miranda would love the bar. Notionally described as ""Italian coastal cuisine,"" the food's about fish, vegetables, and sharing; and comes with an obvious health dividend. Be sure to start with cecina made with chickpea flour and try the surprisingly light rice and pasta dishes.	","[

Virginia's,"647 E. 11 St., New York, NY 10009", Contemporary,"Perfectly East Village in scale, this intimate yet ambitious bistro is composed of two slender rooms unified by butterscotch-colored banquettes and whitewashed brick walls hung with framed vintage menus. Fine stemware and items presented on wooden boards lend an upscale manner to the experience. Chef Christian Ramos takes risks while building upon a steady foundation from time spent as a sous chef at Per Se. A crostini of fava bean tapenade and shredded squash is a bright summertime treat-best paired with an icy glass of rosé. Pan-seared striped bass with new potato wedges is sauced with saffron-infused cockle broth; and the black-and-white sablé arranged with a taste of cocoa nib mousse and candied pistachios offers a sweet finish.

Paradou,8 Little W. 12th St. 10014, French,"For a restaurant that refuses to take itself too seriously, the crowd-pleasing bistro cuisine here is no joke. At home along a cobblestoned street in the clubby Meatpacking District, Paradou offers a handful of tables and a stocked bar. Move past the vintage French liquor ads and down a brick-lined hallway to find a year-round back garden outfitted with chandeliers, a high glass roof, and tables crafted from vintage wine crates. The menu's foundation is Provençal cooking, but its lighthearted spirit feels free to stray. Begin with Amish bacon ""crack""-chili-spiked bacon jerky made from Pennsylvania Amish pigs. The duck breast is expertly seared, with crisp skin and a pink center. Don't skip the springy crêpes, filled with Nutella and ripe bananas.	","[

The stately building is a former bank, with century-old architectural details and marble aplenty. As the name would suggest, the menu leans heavily on seafaring classics with an ample raw bar and sushi counter. But more than anything, this kitchen aims to please, with starters like pork belly sliders topped with tangy fennel-lettuce slaw on a brioche bun. Octopus tentacles are crisp yet perfectly tender inside, served resting atop chickpeas with a deep-red tomato and roasted pepper ragout infused with smoked paprika. Fish is always perfectly handled and often rises well above its accompaniments on the plate. Live jazz is a nightly draw to the downstairs lounge.	","[

With that in mind, this institution is sure to be mobbed until the end. Despite the usual crush, there are few other service teams better at making every diner feel like a cherished guest and there are few other bars more comfortable for solo dining. The menu is hailed for its broad appeal. Seasonal salads and starters include the fried calamari, while signature items like the yellowfin tuna burger are an all-time fave. Pastas are expertly prepared, as in the spaghetti Siciliano with swordfish meatballs and spicy tomato sauce.

It is likewise true to its downtown spirit, in a room that features dim lighting and exposed brick prettied with chalk drawings of orchids and water lilies. The personable staff and menu of Southeast Asian delights are as steady as the constant crowd.

Casa Mono,"52 Irving Pl., New York, NY 10003", Spanish,"Casa Mono is tiny, jammed, and totally New York. Furnished with a few closely packed tables that moan under the excess of mouthwatering plates as well as that mighty counter framed by a handful of seats, this grotto-like wine bar is loud, communal-and an absolute thrill. Then consider the service, which moves like clockwork and confirms that this is no slipshod show. The staff may be brisk in their presentation of the kitchen's ambitious renditions of tapas, but with flavors so delicious and concepts inventive, so be it. A faithful mix of locals and hungry out-of-towners convene for fantastic bite-sized eats like buttery bone marrow with smoked caper chermoulah-a house signature that is rich, flavorful, and entirely unmissable. Even the humble bacalao fritter attains new heights here as a deep-fried, fluffy delight coupled with sweet-citrusy alioli. Lastly, fallback plates like razor clams a la plancha in garlic-parsley sauce remain outstanding, consistent, and full of Spanish soul. This kitchen isn't frightened to explore, so skill and innovation are at the forefront of every morsel, including the thick, creamy, and luscious crema catalana con buñuelos. One word comes to mind: bliss. Oenophiles may head next door to drinking-focused sidekick, Bar Jamón.	","[

Tucked beneath the High Line in the hugely popular Standard Hotel, this clubby-chic grill blends black-and-white tiles, wood-framed windows overlooking Washington Street, and sidewalk seating with classic New York style. Modern downtown esthetics are reflected in their cadre of beautiful servers donning 1970s vintage plaid uniforms. Given its prime location, hip crowd, and sprawling layout, one might expect the food to falter but the culinary team doesn't disappoint. Baked macaroni hits a home run with its creamy blend of trumpet mushrooms, smoky roasted cauliflower, and tangy taggiasca olives; as does the Southern-style Atlantic swordfish, grilled and topped with a lemon- and green olive-salsa.

Aldea,31 W. 17th St. 10011, Mediterranean,"A perfect climate and great scenery-it's easy to see the appeal of life on the Mediterranean. George Mendes' cheerfully run restaurant may not necessarily transport you there but you will leave here feeling as though your serotonin levels have received a timely boost. Those who like to eat whilst deciding what to eat should head straight for the appealing Portuguese selection of petiscos, or snacks-the croquetas de bacalhau and the Serrano ham are good. The main menu is seasonally pertinent and full of dishes to match that southern European climate: they are bright, sunny, and you feel they are doing you good. Nothing says the Med more than sardines-and here they come expertly filleted and dressed with dill and bronzed fennel. But even when the sun's gone down, the kitchen is equally adept at more warming, comforting dishes-try the venison with Swiss chard and chestnuts. The restaurant comes decorated with birch wood and shades of blue and is spread over two narrow rooms. Thanks to the open kitchen, the first floor has more buzz but if you're on a date, ask for the mezzanine level which is a little more intimate.	","[

When the dessert cart rolls around, expect an array of excellent house-made sweets like pristine berries under whisked-to-order zabaglione.	","[

Good looks and a committed service team are the top assets and the décor is timeless yet cozy, aerial yet intimate. Bare bulbs emit a glow over wood tables and that smug, handsome bar should be drawing more diners. The menu's forte lies in its meandering conceit, allowing guests to ""craft"" their own meal. Prices are aggressive and these pristine ingredients often plead for a bit more salt or a bit less cooking, but pastas and desserts are where this kitchen shines. A fall tagliatelle with a bath of white truffles is a stunning example of what's possible.	","[

Gramercy Tavern,"42 E. 20th St., 10003", Contemporary,"In a roll-call of New York's most beloved restaurants of the last couple of decades, Gramercy Tavern would be high on many people's list. It is one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities that it can be all things to all people. You'll probably leave happy whether you've come on a date or are here to impress the in-laws; whether you're closing a deal or simply lubricating the thought processes behind a deal. The ""Tavern"" side is the better one for lunch, especially if there are only two of you and you can sit at the bar-it doesn't take bookings so get here early and join in the grown-up ""I'm not really queuing, I'm just standing here"" queue outside. The ""Dining Room"" is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle, and really comes into its own in the evening. The cooking is the perfect match for the warm and woody surroundings: this is American food sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary. The main component, be it sea bass or pork loin, is allowed to shine and there is a refreshing lack of over-elaboration on the plate that demonstrates the confidence of the kitchen.	","[

There is quite a pronounced Asian flavor in many of the dishes, such as the big bowl of PEI mussels with Kaffir lime, chili paste, and Sichuan pepper. Those, however, who prefer their culinary influences a little more homegrown, will find much comfort in the ""double stack"" burger. Anyone mindful of the heart-its health, not its emotional state-will be reassured by the presence of ingredients like kale on the menu.	","[

The welcome is warm, the ceilings are notably high, and the floor-to-ceiling bar is considerably stocked (note the wine list and its surprisingly large selection from Greece). The dining room is crowded with tables, so go for the cozy corner banquettes overlooking the action. The rustic, satiating fare is ideal for sharing. Thick pieces of octopus are grilled to a buttery softness and served over marinated chickpeas with olives, oregano, and a slick of labneh. In the shakshuka with merguez, a cast iron skillet arrives bursting with flavor and bubbling at the table with a piquant paprika-spiked tomato sauce topped with baked eggs and studded with roasted peppers and sausage.

Warm Parker House rolls are an auspicious prelude to ivory-pink hamachi set over beets with smoked crème fraîche. Fusilli with wild boar ragù and pecorino is nothing short of excellent.

Del Posto,"85 10th Ave., New York, NY 10011", Italian,"In a city like ours, there should be room for all types of restaurants-and that includes those of a more traditional persuasion. The exquisitely attired Del Posto is unashamedly Old School and comes with an expanse of mahogany, acres of marble, and rows of immaculately set tables; you also get a pianist and a veritable army of servers holding down various ranks. In surroundings of such grandeur, it's easy to assume the food will play second fiddle but that would be a mistake because the Italian food here is very good indeed. The menu layout and pricing can be a little bewildering at first but what becomes abundantly clear is that this is a well-orchestrated kitchen and one which demonstrates considerable skill and plenty of genuine care. Fish fin crudo is a great way to start; pasta dishes are surprisingly robust and generously proportioned; and entrées such as lamb with figs come with an awareness of contemporary tastes. Although pastry chef extraordinaire Brooks Headley has left, his signature desserts remain an immortal highlight on Del Posto's menu. The only thing here you'll find difficult is in believing this place is barely over a decade old.	","[

Chef Nick Anderer's menu of Roman-inspired delights brings the upscale scene down to earth with an assortment of hearty preparations, like unctuous honeycomb trippa alla Trastaverina braised in a spicy tomato sauce. Enticing pastas include fat tubes of paccheri dressed with silky white beans, pleasantly bitter escarole, and a touch of rosemary.

The Clocktower,"5 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10010", Contemporary,"British celebrity chef Jason Atherton and restaurateur Stephen Starr are the power players behind this swank space inside the Edition hotel. Housed in a tower built in 1909 for the former Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., it has the buzz and polish of a sleek English club-picture dark wood paneling, jewel-toned velvet furnishings, and vintage celebrity portraits. The cuisine follows suit, with the globe-hopping chef serving up skilled dishes like a foie gras-stuffed pigeon pie in perfect pastry dressed with spiced jus and plated with a light version of the Waldorf salad. Cornish fish stew is sided by decadent garlic mashed potatoes; and a dessert of strawberries and cream features gelée-crowned vanilla custard, olive oil cake, and strawberry verjus sorbet.	","[

Foragers City Table,300 W. 22nd St. 10011, Contemporary,"Chef Nickolas Martinez flaunts his pedigree with intensity at this homage to all things local and organic. The restaurant-cum-market is an offshoot of an independent grocer in DUMBO, though its kitchen philosophy seems to have arrived via California.Inside, the boxy dining room radiates functionality through large, unemcumbered windows and hardwood tables. It is staffed and patronized by the sort of local-loving sycophants who consider it an honor to dine here. And it actually is.Begin with Sfoglini trumpets generously bathed in a luxurious lamb Bolognese with tender broccoli rabe and earthy brown beech mushrooms. Unabashed spice tingles with every slurp of clear sweet shrimp- chicken- and herb-filled dumpling soup.	","[

Cafe El Presidente,30 W. 24th St. 10010, Mexican,"With its colorful interior signage and indoor/outdoor aesthetic, this tasty taqueria near Madison Square Park could easily pass for a Mexico City hot spot. Soaring ceilings cover an open kitchen and tortilla-production station where disks of masa-the foundation for an enticing lineup of tacos-are turned out at a steady clip. Cafe El Presidente's attention to both quality and creativity is impressive, and proof is in the tacos especiales: wilted Swiss chard combined with roasted poblano chiles and sautéed yellow onion; or a spread of black bean purée topped with diced roasted sweet potato and dusting of cotija. For the ultimate conclusion, go for Gringa Madison, a rich pairing of pork al pastor and melted Chiuhuahua spiked with freshly chopped cilantro.	","[

Eleven Madison Park,"11 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10010", Contemporary,"Chef Daniel Humm's cooking is clever, innovative and at times even a little whimsical; it is robust when it needs to be but also delicate at times and it is this variety and depth that really sets it apart. No menu is presented; instead, you're merely asked to relay your list of allergies as though talking to your pharmacist and your work is done. The 15 or so courses that subsequently appear could be playful, like the carrot tartare made at the table, or display extraordinary understanding of technique, such as the dry-aged veal with bone marrow. The restaurant is housed within the sort of grandeur that could only ever have belonged to a financial institution. It's a hard space to fill-conversations don't so much hang in the air as float up to the vast ceiling and never return. But somehow the room's sheer scale and the well-spaced tables allow you to feel cocooned in your own world. Considerable help comes courtesy of the engaging staff as they explain each dish in loving terms but without ever sounding too virtuous. They also know when to talk and when to leave you to get on with enjoying yourself.	","[

It should come as no surprise that the beets are divine, whether in a salad of tender grilled wedges plated with strained yogurt, savory pumpkin seed granola, and young arugula; or used to brightly tint a creamy risotto topped with carrot purée and whipped ricotta. But while lovingly prepared vegetables make a strong showing on the menu, it's not all rabbit food here. Other recommendations include tuna tataki dressed with a charred jalapeño vinaigrette; and salmon, cooked so gently it's positively silken, plated with a creative interpretation of caponata.	","[

Junoon,27 W. 24th St. 10010, Indian,"Attention to detail is what sets Junoon far apart from its desi brethren. The façade is dramatic, but once through those ebony doors, the cavernous setting is welcoming and plush with treasures from the subcontinent. The large bar exudes class and fun, with two antique jhoolas (swings) crafted from Burmese teak. Then, walk through a 200-year-old wooden arch and carved panels beyond, seemingly afloat in a reflecting pool, to enter the amber-tinted dining room where tables are luxuriously spaced. The kitchen is patently ambitious and quite successful in presenting a contemporary vision of Indian cuisine. Every dish is thoughtfully composed and highlights only products of top quality. Begin with a thick octopus tentacle sent to the tandoor, emerging crisped, charred, incredibly tender, and served with pickled purple potato as well as herb oil. Murg lababdar tastes of pure elegance in seared and braised de-boned chicken drenched in a sweetly spiced, deeply flavored tomato-onion gravy. The creamy and exceedingly juicy shahi lamb shank is enriched with rose petal-garam masala, cumin, and coriander; while stout cake coddled with orange- and pink peppercorn-meringue is as unexpected as it is divine.

Huge portions and the bold flavors of smoked tempeh, spinach, pine nuts, and cremini mushrooms prove the power of vegetables to dedicated carnivores. Follow this with meaty and woodsy grilled seitan, glazed with violet-mustard and served over a mélange of roasted salsify and sautéed kale surrounded by horseradish cream.

Peter Luger,"178 Broadway, New York, NY 11211", Steakhouse,"Venerated Peter Luger resides in an expansive space reminiscent of old New York and early German ale houses-an endless line of visitors only serves to reiterate how special a place this truly is. Add to that a series of imposing pane windows, wood-paneled walls, and decorative old steins, and find yourself utterly smitten. Begin with thrillingly fatty, thick-cut bacon nearly sweet on the outside, or shrimp cocktail in a rich tomato dressing. But, what truly leaves diners speechless is that delightfully succulent Porterhouse for two, three, or four. These slabs of beautifully naked meat are simple but their marbling is a thing of complexity and perfection, sizzling in drippings. The wedge salad sets a new standard: it is an enormous and crisp slice of iceberg drowned in blue cheese dressing, chopped tomato, and more bacon. The carnivorous feast is complete when sanctified by crispy French fries or excellent creamed spinach. Properly prepped servers are cordial, yet informal and never chatty. A hunk of NY cheesecake, creamy, tart, and served with schlag, is every bit as classic as one imagines. Equally marvelous and dressed to the nines is a ""Holy cow sundae""-the title speaks for itself.	","[

Haldi,"102 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10016", Indian,"It takes serious effort for an Indian restaurant to stand out from the crowd in jam-packed Curry Hill, but by highlighting the cuisine of Calcutta and its faction of Jewish immigrants, this arrival does just that. Haldi translates to turmeric in Hindi, and the space is rightfully decorated by the liberal use of yellow throughout. Executive Chef Hemant Mathur heads up this operation along with the other members in restaurateur Shiva Natarajan's empire. Discover unique tastes like mangshor chop, a crunchy ground lamb-and-potato patty served with cilantro chutney; fish-fry Calcutta-style served with mustard-and-onion relish; or chicken makmura featuring minced chicken meatballs cooked in a rich creamy curry made from almonds and cashews.

NoMad,"1170 Broadway, New York, NY 10001", Contemporary,"The reputation of the seductively louche NoMad hotel, housed within a strikingly bohemian beaux-arts building, owes much to the considerable talents of Will Guidara and Chef Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park, as they look after all things relating to food and drink. The glass-roofed Atrium is the chief pleasure dome but a meal in NoMad's land is a moveable feast and some prefer eating in the more languid surroundings of the Parlour, where there's a little less head swiveling and competitive dressing. Wherever you sit, you'll find the service confident and engaging and the menu hugely appealing. Don't come expecting the culinary pyrotechnics of Eleven Madison Park: here it's about familiar flavors in more approachable, less intricate dishes, but with the same care and understanding of ingredients. Chicken-which, if we're honest, would be the final meal of choice of many of us-is the undoubted star; they roast a whole bird, pimp it up with foie gras and black truffle and serve it for two. Bone marrow adds depth to beef, while asparagus with bread sauce shows the kitchen is equally adept when subtlety is required. For dessert, look no further than the aptly named ""Milk & Honey.""	","[

Baingan bartha is a sumptuous blend of roasted and mashed eggplant cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices.

Attached to the markedly hip Ace Hotel, this uber-stylish gastropub, known for its pretty patrons and perpetual buzz, is a place to see and be seen. Booths tucked into nooks on one side of the room are by far the best seats in the house, but all is not lost if you can't nab one. Close-knit tables adorned with white china and rustic wooden boards are equally inviting, with views of the open kitchen. If your welcome was a bit...well lukewarm...you'll find that the tee- and tattoo-donning staff warms up as service progresses-not unlike one's appreciation for the chef's outstanding creations. Parmesan and fried parsley leaves gild the romaine in a delicious, very garlicky Caesar salad; just as a coiled link of terrifically flavored merguez is perfectly finished with smoky Marcona almond aïoli. Meanwhile, warm and milky burrata gains great flavor and texture when kissed by nutty hazelnut pesto. Clementine cake frosted with mascarpone and dates is a sweet example of how this kitchen elevates seemingly simple eats to thoroughly stellar treats.	","[

Juni,12 E. 31st St. 10016, Contemporary,"Australian exports don't just include beef and precious metals-these days its chefs also seem highly prized by various countries around the world. Being largely unhindered by an allegiance to a particular culinary tradition seemingly allows them to freely embrace innovation and creativity, and they all arrive with a healthy international outlook. Cairns-born Shaun Hergatt's cooking is certainly original. Whether you're having the squab with salsify or the ""rabbit and the carrot,"" you'll know you're in the hands of a kitchen with a mastery of modern cooking techniques. His dishes are all artfully presented creations and the combinations of superlative ingredients and well-defined flavors display far greater depth than the somewhat terse three-word menu descriptions would suggest. The dining room, within the Hotel Chandler, is a touch anodyne and tables are ridiculously far apart, but the atmosphere remains far from solemn thanks, in no small part, to the personality and genuine care shown by the well-informed and helpful service team.

HanGawi,12 E. 32nd St. 10016, Korean,"Beyond an ordinary façade lies this serene, shoes-off retreat with traditional low tables, Korean artifacts, and meditative music. Said footwear is stored in cubbies, seating is the color of bamboo, and clay teapots adorn the back wall. The setting is soothing, but the atmosphere is surprisingly convivial, with groups gabbing over stuffed shiitake mushrooms and green tea. The ssam bap offers a fun DIY experience with a long platter of fillings. Dark leafy lettuce and thin, herbaceous sesame leaves are topped with creamy slices of avocado, crunchy bean sprouts, pickled daikon, carrot, cucumber, radish, and three rice options-white, brown, and a nutty, purple-tinged multigrain. Topped with miso ssam sauce, each bite is a fresh burst of uplifting textures.	","[

Out the elevator and beyond the dim (even dingy) hallway, your welcome will be warm and energetic. The long room is clad in dark brown wood, but bright with large windows and very good service. Take it as an auspicious sign that Japanese is spoken at many of the tables. Midday is limited to the budget-friendly lunch set, as in a tasty shio saba meal of grilled mackerel with a salad, miso soup, and pickles. The wide-ranging evening menu includes overnight dried squid, Berkshire pork belly in a sweet soy sauce, tsukune (grilled chicken meatball), and a few Western-influenced snacks like French fries with rosemary salt.

Kang Suh,"1250 Broadway, New York, NY 10001", Korean,"A longtime favorite of Korean barbecue fans, this lively yet homey joint delivers an authentic and charming experience. Donning an old-school vibe, the room may seem trapped in time, but be assured as there is delish food and free-flowing soju on deck here. Bypass the first floor and find a roost on the second level, where warm, almost maternal servers with a sense of humor present an array of fragrant grilled meats. The haemool pa jeon is a flaky seafood pancake and excellent starter that may be trailed by delicate slices of galbi sizzling on the grill. Further indulge this meat feast with jaeyook gui or marinated pork grilled to pink perfection. Yet still be sure to save room for boodae chongol-a bubbling stew of kimchi, pork, vegetables, and noodles.	","[

A neon pink ""M"" lights up the front window, through which passersby can glimpse a sort of grandmotherly chef folding dumplings with myriad fillings. Each wrapper color indicates what is tucked within, with green for vegetable, white for pork, and pink for seafood. True to its name, these mandoo can be found on every table. Crisp fried pork goon mandoo are half-moon shaped and seared until brown and blistered, stuffed with minced pork seasoned with Chinese chives. Simple flavors are the hallmarks of their boiled vegetable dumplings-enticingly plump and chewy. The full kitchen also offers an array of larger dishes, like jap chae and bi bim bap.	","[

Settle into the ground floor or head up a labyrinth of stairs to enter yet another pleasant dining room filled with tropical accents, tabletop grills, and cozy dining nooks. This lady is loved by many, so go with a group to really explore the menu and indulge in authentic japchae stir-fried with beef and veggies, or flaky seafood pancakes. Dolsot bibimbap highlights crusty rice spiced with kimchi and gochujang, while those pork mandoo are extra divine when dunked in light soy. Barbecue pork belly could be prize-winning.	","[

Inside, a top-notch venting system lets diners enjoy a smoke-free evening of exceptional grilled meats. Start wtih deep-fried pork mandu, which are crisp, on-point, and extra divine. Wonderfully flaky buchu gochu pajeon is studded with chives for perfect flavor; while pork belly marinated in red wine is smoky and supremely tender.

Non-barbecue options feature tasty Korean favorites, with starters like mandoo, japche, and pajun.

Prepare yourself to be immersed in a noisy setting, wafting with food aromas, where orange-shirted servers whiz by, balancing trays heaped with plates of banchan, sizzling stone bowls of bibimbap, or empty dishes from instantly re-set tables. You may feel compelled to order right away as the line out the door makes for a less than leisurely ambience, but relax. The staff is pleasant and the vast menu is worth perusing.

2nd Avenue Deli,162 E. 33rd St. 10016, Deli,"While the décor may be more deli-meets-deco and there's a tad less attitude, this food is every bit as good as it was on Second Avenue. Ignore the kvetching and know that this is a true Jewish deli filled with personality, and one of the best around by far. The menu remains as it should: kosher, meat-loving, and non-dairy with phenomenal pastrami, pillowy rye, tangy mustard, perfect potato pancakes, and fluffy matzoh balls in comforting broth. Have the best of both worlds with the soup and half-sandwich combination. Carve a nook during midday rush, when in pour the crowds. The deli also does takeout (popular with the midtown lunch bunch), and delivery (grandma's pancakes at your door). Giant platters go equally well to a bris or brunch.	","[

From the lunch hour business crowd to the lively, post-work bar scene, Wolfgang's jams in locals and tourists alike-each coming for the classic fare and precise Manhattans. The service can be gruff at times, but they have a good track record of squeezing you into a table or perch at the bar without a reservation. Once seated, the bone-in Porterhouse, cooked rare, is the only way to go. It arrives sizzling in its own liquid fat and topped with butter. Save space for a slice of bacon-a must-order appetizer-creamed spinach, and crispy German potatoes with yet more salt and fat (at this point, why not?). Just beware: while dishes are sized to share, they're priced like Maseratis.	","[

Lugo,One Penn Plaza, Italian,"In a blah locale that's overshadowed by crowds spilling from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, this café shines bright as a recommendation for Italian eats. A boisterous scene prevails, as the bar and dining room are overwhelmingly popular among business folk. Light streaming in from the floor-to-ceiling windows shows off a white-tiled bar area and black-and-white photography. A pastel-green Vespa adds an extra dose of charm. Tables receive a satisfying array of items like warm hand-pulled mozzarella, Neapolitan-style pizza, and zesty entrées like Mediterranean branzino with spicy puttanesca. Pasta is deftly prepared and certainly a worthy indulgence, especially the tiny ridged tubes of rigatoncini coated with slow-cooked, meaty Bolognese.	","[

A meal at the curvaceous bar would best begin with some salumi and formaggi, or pappa al pomodoro thick with bread, tomato, Tuscan kale, white beans, and Pecorino Romano. Pasta is as enticing as the crispy pizzas-cresta di gallo satisfies with escarole maccheroni (in the shape of a rooster's crest) tossed with tomatoes, red onion, chilies, guanciale, and pecorino.

Warm, fluffy, and house-made, it's just one of the reasons why Cho Dang Gol is a standout for Korean cuisine. In fact, the restaurant is named for a South Korean village famous for its soybean curd. Next in line for your attention is a listing of bubbling-hot jjigaes featuring the likes of short rib, taro, and glass noodles. House specials like a wild sesame-and-mushroom casserole are also a hit. Though the staff can be brusquely efficient-a product of the high business volume-Korean artifacts and rustic wooden tables lend a sweet sentimentality to the place that, combined with the fresh, high-quality food, make it well worth a visit.

The setting is clean and simple (think Korean barbecue hall) and the staff genuinely warm and friendly, but the lip-smacking roster of classics is the real draw here. Past the lineup of terrific bi bim baps, don't miss the excellent mandu, fried to perfection and piped with tender pork and vegetables; or japchae, a sweet potato noodle stir fry; or one of the restaurant's increasingly popular lunch specials-imagine a refreshing bowl of naengmyeon served in icy cold broth.

No matter where you sit, the servers are attentive, the linens are thick, chargers are monogrammed with a goldleaf ""F"" and every last detail is very, very lovely. As one might expect of a Michael White restaurant, pastas here are masterful. Begin with perfectly al dente spaghetti evenly coated in subtly sweet tomato sauce with flakey crabmeat, gently spiced red chilies, and grated bottarga. Fish courses can be even more enticing. Dine on some of the brightest, freshest halibut known to this city, served on an excellent mix of smoky butter beans, chopped pancetta, artichokes, crispy golden croutons, and wonderfully minerally cavolo nero.

The almost overwhelming menu features dozens of cold and hot appetizers, noodles, entrées, and desserts. From refreshing pieces of cold-poached chicken tossed with a generous mound of chili-oil and peanuts, to aromatic smoked tofu mingled with silky batons of celery stalk, flavors here often bring more complexity than straight heat and the presentations are more genteel than brute. But that's not to say the kitchen doesn't conduct a fiery arrangement-try crisp, meaty, and double cooked pork belly harmonized with hot Sichuan peppercorns, green bell peppers, leeks, and fermented black beans. It's a face-melting experience that is more New York authentic, but still, devilishly delicious.	","[

Al di Là,"248 5th Ave., New York, NY 11215", Italian,"This long-loved Park Slope gem from husband-and-wife team Emiliano Coppa and Chef Anna Klinger (of the Crown Heights café Lincoln Station) has been deliciously consistent over the years. Inviting and lived-in with wooden pew seating, dainty wallpaper, and a blown glass chandelier, it's both comfortable and chic enough for a romantic dinner a due. Al di Là's Italian delights are northern in spirit and include enticing preparations. A salad of roughly chopped escarole is tossed with thinly shaved Jerusalem artichokes, slivers of red onion, diced crisped pancetta, toasted walnuts, and a warm sherry vinaigrette. When offered, the lasagna alla Bolognese, fashioned from sheets of fresh pasta and served hot from the oven with crisped edges, is a must.	","[

Tempura Matsui,222 E. 39th St. 10016, Japanese,"With a whopping 40 years of experience in Japan under his belt, tempura master Chef Masao Matsui requires just three ingredients-flour, water, and egg-to transform a larder of exceptionally fresh seafood and vegetables into a feast unlike any other in New York City. Tempura Matsui is tucked into the corner of a non-descript residential tower, lending an air of Japanese authenticity from its location that's amplified by a luxuriously old-world interior. A counter surrounding the chef's station seats a row of Matsui aficionados set comfortably with lacquer trays, handmade ceramic platters, and gorgeous implements, while a handful of booths offer a much more limited view of the virtuoso proceedings. Diners hoping for fare with American flair will be disappointed, as the food here caters to students of traditional Japanese cuisine. Chef Matsui is a watchful presence, guiding his sous-chefs to produce pieces that are pale gold, delicately crisp, and perfectly cooked. House-made goma dofu, chawan mushi, and sashimi begin the feast, but as lovely as these bites are, they are merely the opening act for the divine tempura-mouthwatering shrimp head, sweet hunk of King crabmeat, and seaweed-wrapped scallop.

But to sushi-loving diehards, this is just the cost of admission. Tables packed with suits (this is midtown, after all) should be avoided in favor of the sleek counter attended to by a pristinely attired staff as this is where the magic happens. And, your experience here depends entirely on the itamae enlisted in front of you. Their mission is to ensure that each diner receives fish that has just been cut, formed, and dressed moments before it is eaten. After years of buildup, this kitchen is finally living up to its hype-with a wealth of classically assembled and spectacularly fresh sushi on offer. Every item is handled with such care and is truly memorable: a sparkling combo of sea scallop and oyster is sprinkled with soy sauce, sea salt, and lemon; a duo of uni lets the palate compare specimens from Santa Barbara and Hokkaido; and a trio of King, Alaskan white, and wild New Zealand salmon nigiri makes for a fantastic treat.

Toward the back of the restaurant, the formal dining room cuts an impressive, elegant figure with sexy low lighting; crisp white tablecloths; and polished table settings. Dinner might begin with a beautifully composed peekytoe crab salad, sporting vibrant green avocado panna cotta, juicy watermelon and sea beans; and then move on to a gorgeous slice of fresh Alaskan black cod in a sweet and savory marinade, paired with crisp snap peas, bok choy, and choy sum.

Here, sunny yellow walls, rustic farmhouse tables topped with fresh flowers, and a staff that's genuinely gracious even while attending to the lunchtime throngs make up a completely charming package. As if in defiance of its bustling locale, this authentic osteria gives much cause to sit and savor. The menu offers a taste of Venice in a range of specialties that include risotto nero, pan-roasted calf's livers in an onion gravy, and grilled prawns over soft polenta with sweet paprika sauce. Daily specials are another enjoyable way to go, as in the velvet-smooth, dairy-free spinach soup buoyed by a fontina crostini; or cavatelli tossed with sausage, sweet peas, and creamy tomato sauce.

Helmed by Chef/restaurateur Geoffrey Zakarian and reimagined by designer Thierry Despont, this handsome retreat is a glamorous art deco backdrop of ebonized walls and red leather seating set aglow by stainless steel torchieres and a fireplace. It's a fitting scene for the novel American food that follows. Try slow-poached halibut with crispy frog's legs and licorice herbs, paired with seasonal sides like roasted carrots with prune purée and pecan granola. End with apple crisp ""tatin"" sandwiching flaky pastry, roasted apples, and caramel mousse.	","[

The front lounge is abuzz with post-work and pre-theater gaggles, while well-behaved crowds in the back are seated in a walnut-paneled space dressed with mirrors and black-and-white photography. Like its setting, the menu is inventive and unites classic bistro cooking with market-inspired creations. That lush pâté en croute is a buttery pastry encasing layers of creamy country pâté, guinea hen, and foie gras, dressed with huckleberry compote, toasted pine nuts, and pickled enoki mushrooms. Wild rice-crusted fluke presented with Hawaiian blue prawn and sauce Américaine further demonstrate the kitchen's contemporary leanings.	","[

At least this sleek, moodily-lit Chinese restaurant comes with an 80-foot corridor behind its front door, allowing you time to adjust from tourist town to sexy sanctum. Cobalt-blue glass, marble and mirrors help create a striking space that feels surprisingly intimate considering its size. Service may need the occasional prompt but the Cantonese food is good and the cocktails terrific. Standouts are stir-fried sugar pea shoots with crabmeat and scallops, and jasmine tea-smoked chicken. And if you're wondering how they charge what they do for sesame prawn toast, order it and you'll see (clue: it's the foie gras).	","[

Grab an intimate table for two or join the crowd at the open kitchen counter surrounding the smoky robata grill. The waiters talk up the omakase, but it's worth trusting your own instincts to guide you on a personalized tour through their authentic offerings. The sukiyaki is a must-try seasonal offering of tender marbled beef served in a hot pot bobbing with a beaten egg, tofu, vegetables, and noodles. Other favorites include smoky bamboo shoots fresh off the robata with shaved bonito; and their legendary tsukune, a tender ground chicken meatball brushed with teriyaki and dipped in raw egg.	","[

Bobby Van's,"230 Park Ave., New York, NY 10169", American,"Nestled at the base of The Helmsley building near Grand Central lies Bobby Van's, a perennial favorite of the expense-account set. Its classic steakhouse atmosphere-gruff but prompt service, noisy post-work bar scene, and gargantuan portions-is met with commendable dishes that reach beyond the normal chop shop fare. While the beef speaks for itself, the kitchen's execution takes common combos to the next level: mozzarella and tomatoes are drizzled in flavorful balsamic and olive oil with a chiffonade of basil and shallots; while soft-shell crabs arrive perfectly battered and tempura fried. This massive special, with crisp asparagus and bed of sautéed spinach, showcases great culinary technique and seasonality not expected from a midtown lunch hangout.	","[

The two-room space is cozy and boasts a rustic charm with its lemon-yellow walls and displayed wine storage. The steady kitchen turns out consistently impressive cuisine that starts off with a listing of crudo, such as petals of pale pink seabream simply but impeccably dressed with Meyer lemon-infused olive oil, Amagansett sea salt, and black pepper. Other plates reveal seared monkfish liver, custard-soft within, served atop radicchio, organic grains, and candied citrus. The house-made bucatini with Rita's spicy octopus sauce is deliciously zesty. Dessert may highlight a semolina pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla yogurt.	","[

Vitae,4 E. 46th St. 10017, Contemporary,"Ordering an Old Fashioned at lunchtime is fraught with all sorts of social implications so praise be to restaurants like Vitae, which are grown up enough to ensure that no eyebrows are raised when someone decides they want lunch the old fashioned way. This is a sophisticated and elegant midtown restaurant with an appealing self-confidence. Even the soundtrack appears to have been chosen by someone who actually knows what good music sounds like. Service is snappy, assured, and well-organised. The menu is contemporary without being faddish. Flavor combinations, such as the sesame salmon with soy, are recognizable and complementary and dishes pass that most basic of tests: they are very easy to eat. And those cocktails are pretty good too.	","[

Patroon exudes the air of a private club-one where suited professionals huddle over drinks at the sleek bar; and dining rooms fill with power lunchers who smoke cigars on the rooftop. That this restaurant draws a devoted crowd of regulars should come as no surprise; the maître d' and his gracious servers are top-notch and the kitchen team is highly competent. Come dinnertime, the classic cooking is especially impressive: bracing ceviche may feature Long Island fluke; then Dover sole is plated tableside; and light yet satisfying leek gratin caters to diners who would rather invest the calories elsewhere-say a fine pour from the well-curated wine list or a perfect crème brulée for dessert.

Tulsi,211 E. 46th St. 10017, Indian,"Anyone who loves their Indian food but got jaded by the generic ghee-heavy menus of Curry Hill should head along to Tulsi. In place of the seizure-inducing colored lighting, this midtown favorite offers billowing muslin and neutral tones; and instead of the usual Bollywood clichés, it provides tranquil, sophisticated surroundings, and attentive, sweet natured service. The menu is also markedly different from the norm. For the appetizers, the kitchen takes the sort of snacks you can find streetside on Chaupati and, by putting its own spin on them (and using primary ingredients), raises them to new heights-such as with the white beans of ragda chaat, which is a great way to start your meal. You can also go Goan for some Portuguese influence with the succulent shrimp balchao. But, be sure to leave room for authentic goat biryani served on the bone, or something from the tandoor like those tender lamb chops. As a nod to local tastes, spicing can be a little timid but those who are familiar with India-and anyone who knows their silly mid-on from their backward point-will still find much to savor.	","[

Orchid-topped tables look even prettier once the food arrives. The wallet-friendly and over-flowing lunch buffet brings office workers in by droves, while the early evening prix-fixe is popular with the pre-theater crowd. Delights include tandoori chicken kali mirch liberally seasoned with crushed black pepper, as well as Hyderabadi shrimp curry with a bright red tamarind and chili sauce so tasty it begs to be sopped up by hot wedges of aloo paratha.

For the full theatrical experience, brace your wallet and settle into the omakase. The undeniable quality of each ingredient is center stage, displayed simply on stone glazed pottery.

Opened in 1906, Barbetta is a testament to proper dining out: men are required to don dinner jackets, outerwear is mandatorily checked, and a brigade of starched servers flit about the hushed and gilded surrounds. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the impossibly romantic patio has been the backdrop for countless marriage proposals. The kitchen's Northern-influenced specialties are listed on thick cardstock, and each selection is highlighted by the year of its addition to the menu. Linguine with pesto alla Genovese is as scrumptious today as it was in 1914; while luscious rabbit alla Piemontese, dating back to the Clinton era and braised in white wine and lemon, is equally divine.

With a retro décor that spans two floors and a business that's run like a machine, Hatsuhana is a go-to for corporate dining. Though the rave reviews came decades ago, their traditional Edomae sushi still holds its own. Fish is top quality, the army of chefs have solid knife skills, and rice is properly prepared. This reliability draws a host of regulars who develop relationships with the itamae. Stick to the counter and go omakase: the sushi will be surprisingly impressive with accommodations for the spicy tuna-set.

Bare-wood tables, exposed bricks, and chandeliers cleverly made of wine bottles enhance the undeniably jovial space. An orange-tiled bar, wall of banquettes, and spacious booths ensure seating for any size group. Start with a martini glass filled with slices of tender raw steak ceviche in limey marinade with red onion, tomato, and chopped cilantro, served with ancho chili-dusted house chips. Then, move on to the agave-marinated pork loin, moist and glistening over a mound of buttery white rice and grilled vegetables-though the star of that dish (and many others) is the rust-colored mole.

Pampano,209 E. 49th St. 10017, Mexican,"Nothing screams you need a trip to Acapulco like a stressful day in midtown, and we've got your remedy. Pampano, a popular Mexican seafood restaurant, offers two types of oases for the weary worker: downstairs, you'll find a lively bar (especially come happy hour) with a few small tables to enjoy their botanas menu; upstairs, you'll find a transporting, beachy dining space with whitewashed ceilings, wicker chairs, lazy ceiling fans, and an outdoor patio. Don't miss the fresh guacamole; excellent rotating list of ceviches, plump with off-the-boat fish and humming with bright lime; or grilled grouper, marinated in achiote and wrapped in banana leaf. Next door, Pampano Taqueria keeps the hungry lunch crowds at bay with delicious tacos on the fly.	","[

Smith & Wollensky,"797 3rd Ave., New York, NY 10022", Steakhouse,"Sitting proudly on the corner of Third Avenue for nearly 40 years, Smith & Wollensky is a veritable New York institution. This is the kind of clubby steakhouse where stellar martinis are still poured tableside and the regulars get their names engraved on a plaque. It's where business deals go down and old-time Manhattanites live it up. Begin with beloved classics, including a beefsteak tomato-and-onion salad finished with house dressing and crumbled blue cheese; or spoon-licking sides like creamed spinach, crispy hash browns, and crunchy onion rings. Then, allow the adept servers to steer you towards the in-house favorite-namely, a beautifully marbled, deliciously fatty, and perfectly tender Colorado rib steak, bone-on and big enough for three.

Inside, find a cool aqua-accented space that inspires dressing up. Yes, tourists flock here after a spin on the ice, but it is also popular among business crowds-especially at lunch when the bar is bustling with sharp suits munching on lobster tail with a martini on the side. The food itself is light and fresh. In-season you may find soft-shelled crab, served alongside a seaweed salad with citrus-marinated hearts of palm. The Northeast supplies many local seafood choices, such as the Block Island golden snapper a la plancha, with tangy cherry-tomato vinaigrette. Dependable and familiar classics like jumbo lump crab cakes are also on offer.	","[

Glimpse their expert chefs who seem contentedly trapped behind a glass kitchen wall. Featuring a noisy and yuppie set, this tri-level space is decorated (albeit oddly) with clunky wooden booths, closely set tables, and private rooms. Peek into the kitchen for a whiff of tandoori treats and Mughlai specialties. Dahi aloo papri or spicy potatoes and chickpeas tossed in yogurt and tamarind is a predictably perfect starter. The signature, wickedly creamy dal Bukhara will have you coming back for more (tomorrow). Even if the service may range from sweet to clumsy, hand-crafted breads meant to sop up the likes of sarson ka saag remain a crowning glory.	","[

The décor seems French, but the cuisine leads to the Eastern Mediterranean with a definite stop in Turkey.

Hand-pulled and hand-cut noodles are stir-fried with a number of mouthwatering accompaniments; while the dumpling variety is so great it's almost impossible to focus. Herb-spiked pork and shrimp wonton soup is well worth the 20-minute wait, allowing diners plenty of time to devour pan-fried Peking duck bundles and scallion pancakes stuffed with sliced beef; or steamed buns full of mushroom and bok choy.

The inside may appear cramped at first, but perception shifts once seated as the fireplace, exposed brick walls, pressed-tin ceiling, and shelves lined with books work their cozy magic. Dishes are layered with flavor, including chewy herb spaetzle and wilted greens topped with grilled lamb sausage and mustard seeds. Pickled red cabbage tops a pork chop sliced off the bone, with a light yet delish potato gratin on the side. High-minded desserts may include a warm carrot cake with fragrant cardamom syrup.

Brasserie Ruhlmann,"45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10111", French,"True, some New Yorkers may think of this place as kind of touristy, but this is quintessential brasserie cooking in an equally quintessential Manhattan setting at the base of Rockefeller Center, overlooking its plaza. There is little debate that this French bijou offers some of the best people-watching around. The décor pays homage to its art deco namesake, Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, through edgy lines and geometric prints. Some dishes may be on the menu more for pleasing the crowds than reflecting tradition (hence the sushi rolls). Still, the croque monsieur is everything you dream it to be-impossibly rich with paper-thin and salty jambon de Paris, creamy béchamel, and a dangerously good layering of melted Gruyère over thick slices of brioche.

Le Bernardin,155 W. 51st St. 10019, Seafood,"Eric Ripert's paean to all things piscatorial is unquestionably one of the daddies of the New York dining scene. No one gets to occupy this amount of prime midtown real estate for this long without knowing exactly what they're doing-and doing it supremely well. Run with consummate ease by a well-organized team, its influence stretches beyond merely the entertaining of big-hitters and even bigger spenders. But however celebrated, the sine qua non of any self-respecting seafood restaurant must be the ability to cook a piece of fish absolutely perfectly and, in this, Le Bernardin displays deftness and consistency. Just try the luxuriantly buttery wild striped bass and you'll get the idea. ""Almost Raw,"" ""Barely Touched,"" and ""Lightly Cooked"" are the headings under which you'll find an impressive array of dishes. The influences are global but the cooking is underpinned by a mastery of technique; ingredients are of unimpeachable quality and the kitchen has the confidence to never overcrowd a plate so that the fish always remains the star of the show.

Print,"653 11th Ave., New York, NY 10036", American,"Travel to these western hinterlands and breath a whiff of Californian sensibility. Print's home, off the lobby of the Ink48 hotel, has an easy-breezy layout that unites lounging and supping in a space that is pleasantly moody and particularly cozy. The talented team behind this locavore kitchen takes its mission seriously: there is a full time forager on payroll, water is poured into recycled glasses, the kitchen composts, and the menu highlights the provenance of ingredients.

During the summer, ride up to the 16th-floor Press lounge for drinks, small plates, and killer views.	","[

Hide-Chan Ramen,248 E. 52nd St. 10022, Japanese,"There is a meticulous science and culture to this ramen-ya that has seemingly perfected the customized noodle experience. Two suggestions to novices: dine during off-hours to avoid their mile-long line; and ponder exactly how firm you like your ramen cooked and rich you like your broth before even stepping afoot. The décor may not say much, but the food speaks volumes in terms of authenticity and flavor. Start with steamed buns of succulent pork or pan-fried gyoza, before moving on to enticing mains centered around unbeatable renditions of ramen. Kuro ramen features an intensely nourishing and garlicky tonkotsu broth bobbing with bits of char siu. Meanwhile, health-conscious NYers are in luck, as both vegetable and chicken broth are also on offer here.	","[

La Grenouille,3 E. 52nd St. 10022, French,"La Grenouille is a bastion of old-world glamor and manners with an exorbitant budget for floral arrangements. Although this storied enclave still attracts a devoted following, there's always room for local newbies and blinged-out tourists. Everyone looks good in this lavish space, where red velvet banquettes, polished wood veneer, and softly lit tables bathe the room in rose and apricot hues. Classic and classy, this French cuisine deserves high praise. Delicate ravioli is stuffed with chopped lobster hinting of tarragon and dressed with creamy, tart beurre blanc; an exquisitely tender-seared beef filet arrives with pommes Darphin and a lick of perfect sauce au poivre; and for dessert, the île flottante is heaven under a cloud of spun caramel.

The Four Seasons,99 E. 52nd St. 10022, American,"The name alone invokes an image straight out of Mad Men-with beautiful sophisticates and well-dressed men rubbing elbows in a posh, mid-century room with mile-high ceilings, breathtaking flower arrangements, and intimate tables circling a center fountain. In real life, The Four Seasons is all that and more, with a rollicking fun seating chart that's a see-and-be-seen affair; excellent (if no longer particularly groundbreaking) food; an impeccable wait staff; and ultra-glamorous décor. Kick things off with exquisitely fresh steak tartare, expertly prepared tableside. Then move on to tender and flaky Dover sole kissed with Hollandaise; followed by a near-perfect soufflé with Grand Marnier. Speaking of alcohol, go on and order that martini-Don Draper would.	","[

Opened originally as a speakeasy, this New York institution has wined and dined everyone from movie stars and moguls to moneyed city folk. From its lantern-holding jockeys and townhouse exterior, to the leather- and wood-paneled dining room that feels like a step back in time, this is a classic through and through. The menu is a perfect accompaniment to the setting with choices like seared foie gras tinged with mango chutney and spread atop toasted brioche; or a splendid and classic rendition of steak tartare paired with a green salad. Upstairs and in the back, the feel is formal-so for a casual bite with prettier prices, head off the main entrance to Bar 21.	","[

Braai,329 W. 51st St. 10019, South African,"From its ground floor townhouse home, Braai is adored for tantalizing South African cuisine. Two tables sit up front in a snug patio, which dovetails into a long and slender dark wood space. Drawing inspiration from its region, wide planks make up the floors while the arched ceiling is thatched with straw. Yet the African-inspired décor in the dining room, set with marble-topped communal tables, is anything but cliché. The menu is resplendent with new and balanced flavors that are at once evident in frikkadel, a classic dish of baked meatballs in broth; or calamari drenched in a lovely wine-lemon emulsion. Speaking of mainstays, bunny chow, a street treat of lamb curry ladled into a bread bowl, is a favorite here as well as at nearby sib, Xai Xai.	","[

Gallagher's,228 W. 52nd St. 10019, Steakhouse,"A multi-million dollar renovation hasn't glossed over any of Gallagher's iconic character. Walls covered with photos of horses and jockeys harken back to the 85-year-old stallion's former proximity to the old Madison Square Garden. The menu's ""other soup"" is a sly reference held over from Prohibition days; and diners still walk past the window-fronted meat locker where slabs of USDA Prime beef are dry-aged. Gallagher's fresh sparkle is exhibited by the display kitchen, set behind glass panes. The chefs here turn out contemporary-minded fare like hamachi crudo with a yuzu-jalapeño vinaigrette to go with choice cuts of meat grilled over hickory. The rib steak is a bone-in ribeye that arrives mouthwateringly tender with a side of warm and savory house sauce.	","[

Chevalier,28 W. 53rd St. 10019, Contemporary,"Bearded hipsters are not the target market for every new opening. This glamorous brasserie within the Baccarat Hotel is unashamedly geared to the more grown-up members of the city's social scene-those for whom 53rd Street is downtown. The space exudes old-school charm as the dapper waitstaff coddles those Manhattan powerbrokers and their mink-trimmed cohorts. The menu offers a modern re-working of classic French dishes. The clientele are not the sort to be too concerned by prices but at least one can see where the money goes. The scallops, served with comté and morels, are huge and the veal loin with sweetbreads is not for the fainthearted. And as you would expect from a hotel called Baccarat, the glassware is pretty impressive too.	","[

Smartly styled in wood and bamboo, it's packed with expats lingering over elaborate meals attended to by an amicable staff. The menu is traditional, though the chef's unique influences are well expressed in a massive oyster ""sashimi"" that's sliced in half on the shell and served with a mirin-soy dip and grated radish.

Housed in the basement of the iconic Lever House, this sexy, low-lit space is decked with tufted charcoal bucket seats circling red cocktail tables, wood panels, honeycomb-shaped wine racks, and Warhol-esque artwork. The gracious staff is top-notch. An elegant, Northern Italian menu offers the likes of perfectly roasted, thinly sliced vitello tonnato in that unlikely yet incredibly delicious sauce of tuna, capers, and mayonnaise. Linguine with sea urchin, crab meat, crushed tomato, and peperoncino is generous and beautifully calibrated. To finish, the contemporary millefoglie layers delicate pastry, vanilla Chantilly cream, and raspberry granite.	","[

Art enthusiasts appreciate these modernist surrounds, which are timeless and particularly glorious. The bar-cum-lounge up front is all buzz, while the dining room's view of the lush sculpture garden lends tranquility that is conducive to intimacy and quiet conversation.

Meanwhile, service remains well-timed and always warm. Appealing dishes showcase neat, clean flavors and may include roasted cauliflower florets composed with perfectly creamy crab butter, almond-cauliflower purée, and sweet, fleshy crabmeat. Delicate balance and top quality ingredients are at the height of an exceedingly tender lobster ""marinated with truffles"" and served in a luscious sauce with shaved radishes and bright herbs. And, for dessert, rhubarb bread pudding is topped with vanilla mascarpone mousse and a scoop of Greek yogurt sorbet for a bit of flourish and a whole lot of pleasure.	","[

The fresh, light cuisine begins with beautifully prepared starters like tender, enticingly charred octopus atop chickpeas, roasted pepper, and quick-pickled onions drizzled with lemon and olive oil. Grilled sea bass is a flawless shade of white, salty and crisp-skinned alongside seasonal vegetables like zucchini and buttery pea purée.

The smartly attired staff attends to a buttoned-up crowd digging into pricey but pleasing fare like shaved artichoke salad with organic frisée, lemon, olive oil, and bottarga di muggine. Here, veal scaloppini is a pounded filet layered with grilled eggplant and smoked provolone, alongside braised escarole studded with black olives.

Can't decide? Our favorites saw it rolled with grilled sweet peppers hinting of anchovies and presented sliced over arugula; as well as diced and stuffed into a trio of golden-brown, crumb-coated arancini filled with sweet pea-studded creamy rice. A salad of avocado and shaved fennel with citrus segments and fresh mint is a refreshing starter, and the short list of entrées indulges with a hearty, oven-baked pasta of the day.	","[

Caviar Russe,"538 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022", Contemporary,"No playful pun, no name-check for grandma, no oblique reference to a geographical landmark-whoever christened this restaurant clearly wanted to attract a certain type of customer. This is not the place when you should order by pointing vaguely at the menu-that way lies trouble because you may find yourself having to re-mortgage your apartment to pay for the 250 grams of Oscetra caviar you've just inadvertently requested. Best leave that section of the carte to the oligarchs and retired dictators and concentrate on the main menu. Here you will find contemporary dishes of surprising delicacy and precision, with a pleasing bias towards wonderful seafood and shellfish, such as scallops with ricotta gnudi, or delicious bluefin tuna with uni and asparagus. You get buzzed in at street level, which adds a bit of mystery to proceedings. Up the stairs and you'll find yourself in a lavish little jewel box, with colorful murals on the wall, Murano chandeliers hanging from an ornate ceiling, and semi-circular booths.

Benoit,60 W. 55th St. 10019, French,"In the former home of the venerated La Côte Basque, Alain Ducasse's Benoit brings a hint of fame to this address. The casual bistro is rife with elegance through oak-paneled walls, polished brass, and red velvet seating, all set off by art nouveau lighting fixtures reclaimed from the previous tenants. Peugeot pepper grinders, bread presented in linen sacks, and espresso served in custom-made Pillivuyt cups add to the overall experience. Chef Philippe Bertineau heads the kitchen, bringing a skilled hand to the likes of foie de veau, seared calf's liver paired with potatoes Lyonnaise. Pan-seared monkfish tail is prepared coq au vin-style with red wine sauce, lardons, pearl onions, and sautéed mushrooms. Desserts are categorically magnifique.	","[

Service is young, friendly, and knowledgeable, so make sure to ask for a recommendation as it can yield tasty rewards. Towering ceilings and a wall of windows seem to augment the rather petite space; and a chalkboard wall lists wines available by the glass, even if the most impressive selections are only offered by the bottle on the menu. Contemporary small plates begin with notable cheese offerings like ricotta Ginepro, cold-smoked sheep's milk, and pale yellow Ossau Iraty accompanied by a walnut covered in date-coconut jam and thick, crusty bread from Amy's. Sample skewers lined with garlicky shrimp or spiced lamb. Then finish with a sweet and earnest take on homemade s'mores.	","[

The crackerjack menu highlights thin-crust pizza, Tuscan fish soup (cacciucco alla Livornese); as well as wonderful hand-made pastas like silky tortelli stuffed with finely chopped radicchio and taleggio, dressed with an earthy mushroom purée and salty speck. Italian-American classics like clams casino, eggplant Parmigiana, and chicken Marsala punctuate the lineup.	","[

The kitchen offers countless delectable house delicacies emphasizing the regional focus. Honey ham Shanghai-style is a sweet and salty treat dressed with dates and lotus seeds. The ""eight jewels with hot paste"" is a mouthwateringly spiced stir-fry of mushrooms, bamboo shoots, wheat gluten, scallops, chicken, and shrimp. Green beans with tofu sheets is a gorgeously simple combo of soybeans and paper-thin ribbons of bean curd skin judiciously bathed in a light, broth-based sauce.	","[

A bar and a domed wood-burning pizza oven populate the first floor, while the upstairs is filled with closely set tables and gallery-white walls displaying original art. Expect the room to be packed with a chic, Italian-accented clientele who flock here for blissfully authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas. These are baked to perfect pliability with a bit of char, topped with impeccable ingredients like creamy mozzarella di bufala, broccoli rabe, and sausage. Fine cooking skills are displayed in the paccheri al baccala, tossing pasta tubes with cherry tomatoes, plump Sicilian capers, intense Gaeta olives, and firm fillets of cod.	","[

That oven not only provides a heartwarming welcome and sets the whitewashed interior aglow, but it is also responsible for baking the incredible plank of bread that is alone worth a trip here. Bring friends because this midtown marvel's recently revised menu is best enjoyed by grazing the zesty meze like house-made scallop and crab sausage shakshooka with poached quail egg, or wild mushroom bread pudding with creamy talleggio and romesco. Vegetables aren't spared the flames, as in a luscious and healthy pile of roasted broccolini splashed with orange oil.	","[

Aquavit,65 E. 55th St. 10022, Scandinavian,"Gorgeously Scandinavian yet pleasantly corporate, Aquavit is a tribute to the Nordic culinary movement with more midtown-friendly appeal. The décor flaunts a bit of playfulness thanks to a mossy green carpet, fur-covered bag stools, and retro lighting. The ambience is quiet and waiters a tad imperious. Evening tasting menus and a wonderful three-course prix-fixe with overlapping options mean that an array of appetites and budgets can be readily accommodated. The dinner hour is when the chef's true style shines most brightly, through clean and unfussy cooking that is a lovely blend of European techniques and Scandinavian flavors. Klädesholmen Matjes herring is reinvented for the modern palate, encrusted in seeds and rye cubes served on a piece of slate, alongside soft-boiled quail eggs, Västerbotten cheese, and a swipe of horseradish. Follow this with a springtime composition of crisp-skinned Arctic char over pea purée, nettles, sweet and snap peas, and a few halved shrimp. Desserts that feature a textural composition of chocolates are a contemporary highlight. Lunch is a low-key, business-like gathering of Swedish meatballs and skagen, but the service is thankfully far less uptight.	","[

Besides a dazzling medley of drinks, the kitchen sends out a crowd-pleasing menu showcasing solid technique. Following its repute, the distinct décor spotlights notable artifacts, worn floors, and smartly dressed tables. Weekends draw a touristy set, but who's complaining with an amazing Bloody Mary so close at hand? Highlights include potato chips with an outrageously gooey blue cheese gratin; braised short rib spring rolls with horseradish-tinged sour cream; and tuna tartare tacos filled with scallion and sesame seeds. The cheeseburger is as classic and on-point as the staff itself.	","[

Feast your eyes on the ever-present bounty of iced fish, flown in fresh and displayed in the back of the cavernous room where a well-dressed, business-minded crowd gathers. Oregano plants atop each table are snipped into bowls of olive oil to accompany the fine bread that precedes the selection of raw bar specialties and grilled fish. The day's bounty may reveal charred barbouni, or red mullet, dressed with olive oil, capers, and a sprig of flat leaf parsley. Side dishes unveil chtipiti-a mouthwatering spread made from roasted red peppers and barrel-aged feta that you'll want to slather on everything.	","[

Would you expect anything less of the man whose luxurious Armani Casa furniture lines the space? His streamlined and modern aesthetic prevails, right down to the glistening, ruby-red tuna tartare. Each cube cut by hand, the sea-fresh fish rolls in truffle oil and chives with briny sea beans and trout roe for a fantastic play on texture. Equally precise, the pan-seared spring flounder is infused with a coriander reduction, fresh porcini, and fennel with an airy foam that looks so good it may as well be Photoshopped.	","[

Yakitori Totto,251 W. 55th St. 10019, Japanese,"To say that this yakitori-ya nails authenticity is an epic understatement. Its discreet signage and second floor location feels more Tokyo than Manhattan, J-pop dominates the playlist, and the crowd is a reassuring mix of Japanese-speakers and in-the-know foodies. Best of all is the aroma of sizzling skewers that are deftly prepared over a charcoal fire.

At lunch, go for yakitori don with skewers of chicken breast and green onion (negima) over rice, paired with pickled cucumbers and licked by a sweet yakitori sauce.	","[

Betony,41 W. 57th St. 10019, Contemporary,"Midtown and Betony go together like caviar and blinis. Serious funds have been invested to create this smart, grown-up restaurant and its gilded features, wood paneling, and well-spaced tables provide very comfortable surroundings in which to do business or impress friends. The experienced service team, though, do a good job in ensuring the atmosphere never veers into the terminal seriousness that blights many a formal restaurant. When one surveys this luxurious backdrop and the impeccably manicured clientele, it is perhaps something of a surprise to find that the food is adventurous and creative. Chef Bryce Shuman and his kitchen team know all the latest cooking techniques and are not afraid to use them. Ravioli with smoked potato shows off their delicate touch but the grilled short rib demonstrates that they also know how to create layers of flavor. The menu comes in four sections and one is gently encouraged to have all four, although the hors d'oeuvres are meant more for sharing with a drink. Speaking of drinks, make sure you start by ordering a milk punch-the kitchen isn't the only team here who has some clever ideas and the ability to see them through.	","[

BG,"754 5th Ave., New York, NY 10019", American,"On the 7th floor of Bergdorf Goodman, BG offers ladylike posh to the label-conscious clientele of this fashion emporium. The Kelly Wearstler-designed brasserie combines springtime hues with hand-printed Chinoiserie wallpaper, gilded fixtures, and lacquered accents. Large windows frame killer Central Park vistas and highlight the well-coiffed crowd savoring a number of fine salads. However, the carte du jour offers more vibrant dining with decadent renditions of American comfort favorites, like lobster mac and cheese. The silken tomato basil soup is enriched with just the slightest hint of cream; and Israeli couscous is infused with smoked paprika and stocked with seared black bass and shellfish. Afternoon tea is a suitably refined affair.	","[

Land of Plenty,204 E. 58th St. 10022, Chinese,"A sleek, clean, and subterranean space attended to by adept servers, this Chinese haven feels far more nice and elegant than the other Sichuan spots in midtown. Instead of sweet-and-sour pork, crowds of lively, food-savvy diners come for authentic lunchtime specials prepared by a cadre of talented chefs. The food is just plain stellar, featuring excellent versions of this cuisine's classics, which may start with addictive pickled vegetables or soft pork dumplings paired with sweet soy. While some settle on crunchy conch bathed in roasted chili oil, others opt for smoked duck fried rice to pair with sautéed crispy chicken tossed with chilies and sesame seeds. String beans stir-fried with minced pork and bamboo shoots is a revelatory way to end the affair.	","[

The exterior's detailed stonework features frolicking cherubs and griffins, while a wrought-iron door guards the entrance. Inside, the dining room harkens back to the 80s with its mirrored bar and pink-and-black granite. Lalique crystal fixtures add a touch of timeless bling. The best way to begin a meal at Petrossian is to partake in some caviar, smoked salmon, or foie gras (all available for purchase next door in the boutique). Then dive into a bowl of borscht, served with tiny meat-filled pastries, before treating your palate to seared diver sea scallops with sweet English peas, plump morels, bottarga, and parmesan nage.

The dramatic interior alone warrants a visit: a beautiful semi-circular dining room boasting arching banquettes; a soaring wall of windows; and draping overhead canopies. Chef Raphael Francois is currently holding court in Le Cirque's kitchen, effortlessly blending time-honored recipes with delicious new additions. Don't miss the grilled octopus salad, with tender rainbow potatoes, cherry tomatoes, taggiasca olives, and fresh herbs; or the (Daniel Boulud-created) paupiette of black bass, wrapped in thin sheets of potato, laced with a lovely red wine sauce and served over melted leeks.

The room is minimally revamped, with dark leather furnishings and panoramic photos of sun-bleached coastline that hang on the pale walls. Lovers of Greek cuisine will revel in the cooking's familiar scents and flavors, while marveling at the kitchen's unique, inspired spin. It's possible to feast on starters alone like ladolemono-dressed grilled octopus with fava bean purée, or papoutsakia (stuffed eggplant topped with caramelized béchamel sauce). But, don't overlook the entrées-rooster, braised in red wine as well as spiced tomato sauce and served over Greek pasta, is especially decadent.	","[

Massive portions of scallops, squid, a split langoustine, and lobster star in the grigliata drizzled with lemon vinaigrette. Rely on Lidia to deliver a cannoli that lives up to its true potential-envision narrow tubes filled with lemony ricotta cream spilling into the center of the plate.	","[

Often glimpsed gliding across the restaurant, the husband-and-wife owners warmly cater to locals during pleasant but humming dinner hours. The space makes everyone feel lucky-such solid dining options don't typically exist this far east. Familiar and well-done classics may include an enjoyably but never over-whelmingly flavorful fish soup sided with Gruyère cheese, rouille, and croûtes. The well-executed striped bass arrives with a bed of zucchini cooked in a fragrant tomato-saffron broth; while an ile flottante with caramel sauce is like an ode to a Parisian bistro.	","[

Head to the more formal, rear dining room with tables dressed in white to savor a very authentic Italian meal.

Marea,"240 Central Park South, New York, NY 10019", Seafood,"There are some restaurants that have a discernible pulse that makes you immediately aware you've arrived somewhere a little special. At this elegant and refined Italian restaurant you aren't so much as welcomed in as taken in hand and enveloped in a sort of benevolent bubble of care. It's a grown up establishment with a suitably urbane clientele who all look at home in this part of town. Sit in the main dining room where all the action happens, rather than in the alcove off the bar-which is undoubtedly-Siberia. As the name suggests, seafood and shellfish lie at the heart of the menu. And needless to say, the ingredients are not only of irreproachable quality but are also treated with respect and deftness by the kitchen, whether it's the brilliant white halibut or the salt-baked wild bass. Start with the crudo, and then head for a generous bowl of homemade pasta such as tagliolini with clams and calamari, followed by a whole fish or a classic entrée. It's not of course compulsory to stick to fish-the lamb chops make a worthy alternative. The wine list is a deserving tome and along with the big names are some lesser known growers who merit investigation.	","[

Anassa's menu is an honest presentation of Greek specialties, including a platter of spreads, sushi-quality charcoal-broiled octopus, and a selection of Mediterranean and North Atlantic fish to be grilled and dressed with extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon, and capers. Nightly specials add further variety to the extensive menu.

Per Se,"10 Columbus Circle, New York, NY 10019", Contemporary,"There is no more dramatic departure from the soulless Time Warner Center than entering through the iconic blue doors to Per Se. An upscale sense of calm-the kind that only money can buy-instantly soaks the atmosphere. The words posh and exclusive come to mind when admiring the spacious tables, corner banquettes, and stunning views. Chef Thomas Keller continues to raise the bar with meals that express artistry and seasonality right down to the moment. A classic since day one, the ""oysters and pearls"" still swim in that bath of luxurious caviar. Summery flavors reach their peak in the beautiful roulade of veal breast en persillade. The extraordinary vegetable tasting menu will threaten to convert the most die-hard omnivore with chestnut- and mascarpone-filled agnolotti dressed with julienned Tuscan kale and pickled Swiss chard stems. Flavors and textures may temporarily veer off into strange (and slow) territory during cheese and dessert courses. While this innovative and creative vision may delight some, it will confound others. No matter. The celebrated ""coffee and doughnuts"" is a grand finale. Those without reservations can stop at the opulent Salon, where much of the menu is available à la carte.	","[

Masa,"10 Columbus Circle, New York, NY 10019", Japanese,"To taste what may be the continent's best sushi, experience the quiet, contemplative, and very exclusive ceremony of Chef Masa Takayama's omakase. Through the heavy wooden door, discover a room that is as unchanging and calming as a river stone, set amid blonde hinoki wood and a gargantuan forsythia tree. Yes, you'll forget it's on the fourth floor of a mall. Attention to detail is unsurpassed; that bespoke Japanese porcelain seems designed specifically for the sweet shrimp it holds. Service displays the same smooth grace, unobtrusive yet at-the-ready with their hot towels, fingerbowls, tea, and touches of pedagogy or insight. Don't let their tendency to upsell extra courses mar your pleasure. A seaweed salad of vinegar-seasoned jellyfish awakens the palate to the subtle progression of courses that follow. Masterful proportion and elemental balance is unparalleled in the mind-melting toro tartare with salty grains of Californian osetra caviar and toasted bread for crunch. Yet Masa truly distinguishes itself with its parade of sushi showcasing the best of Tokyo's Tsukiji market. Expect phenomenal aji mackerel with grated yuzu, traditional unagi, and an indelible finish of toro temaki.	","[

Despite the crowds, softly lit Japanese limestone walls give the room an air of serenity. The long list of creative sips are excellent, so lay your lips on a cucumber mint gimlet while eagerly awaiting selections off the extensive menu. Serious effort is blatantly apparent: raw petals of sakura trout are tantalizingly dressed; pudding-soft tofu and perfectly ripe avocado are a heavenly pairing for an uramaki; and fluffy wild mushroom fried rice is sprinkled with wasabi salt.

The views certainly distinguish this handsome retreat from the pack, as do its carefully selected aged meats, quality fish, and expert sides. The kitchen puts out a tasty helping of sweet and spicy onion rings, buttermilk-battered and deep-fried in portions designed for linebackers. The beautifully marbled ribeye is aged for more than 45 days and would be delicious simply seared, though a chili rub adds an aggressive spice. Cool down with a lightly dressed purslane salad.	","[

The food is light and current and the lunch menu, with dishes taken from the main à la carte, is a positive steal-although the immaculately coiffured clientele did not seem the sort to be overly concerned by the concept of a bargain.

Jean-Georges,"1 Central Park West, New York, NY 10023", Contemporary,"The crown-jewel restaurant of a crown-jewel Trump hotel, Jean-Georges reigns supreme over the Central Park dining scene. Facing its lush grounds and mighty Columbus himself, the restaurant's separate entrance can be something of a whirlwind as guests must pass through buzzing Nougatine to arrive at this silver-gray dining room. Still, those immense windows, columns, and twinkling skyline views make this a very special place. On weekdays, the feel is formal and business-driven, while weekends hum with affluent tourists, local socialites, and an easier vibe. The highly professional service staff is one well-oiled and smooth machine. While the contemporary menu is fixed, options are numerous and particularly appealing. Let the fascinating interplay of flavors begin with sea trout and oyster tartare merged with horseradish cream, lemon, and chive oil. Simple but lavish elegance underscores a perfectly cooked Maine lobster accompanied by roasted chili paste. Composed with Asian flavors and French technique, this is a standout worthy of a special occasion. And in place of a single, haunting finale, desserts are served as a ""sampler"" focused on one ingredient-say caramel-in all its outrageous glory.	","[

Fig & Olive,"808 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10021", Mediterranean,"This reliable, Mediterranean-inspired retreat is a popular post-museum (or post-shopping) pick. The sleek long bar glows beneath dangling light fixtures, while the shelf-lined walls are stocked with olive oils in verdant hues of green. Candles flicker over stone tables near plates of glistening olives. An olive oil tasting showcases the stark nuances of different regions and makes an ideal start to a meal, served with fluffy rosemary fougasse. Then, move on to buttery, round tartlets of Gorgonzola dolce, caramelized figs, and chopped walnuts with a pile of arugula lending peppery spark. Nutty, truffle-infused risotto with meaty mushrooms is a high note. A shot glass of luscious chocolate mousse compensates for its paltry size with absolute decadence.	","[

Larger than its previous digs, Park Avenue is a sprawling canvas on which design firm AvroKO works its magic. The restaurant remains a family affair, with father and son Alan and Michael Stillman steadily steering the concept alongside Chef/partner Craig Koketsu. Just like the décor, the menu fully celebrates the seasons. Hearty wintertime flavors have featured mustard seed vinaigrette, Manchego, and chestnut honey-drizzled kale-and-chorizo salad.

It may seem like a simple restaurant for a very good spicy tuna roll, but their excellent and unique omakase is what put it on the map as a worthy favorite. The quality and creativity of each bite shows the chef's training at Sushi of Gari, with added twists. Sample excellent toro chopped with ginger that is at once tender, fatty, and crunchy over rice; or a slice of fatty salmon with avocado sauce.

Their Northern dominated cuisine traces back to the kitchens of the Mughal Empire, which brought Muslim influences to the Indo subcontinent.

Daniel,60 E. 65th St. 10065, French,"The elegant façade, the revolving door, the sound of clinking glasses-even before you reach the dining room you feel a part of something special. This bastion of classical French cooking epitomises the ""special occasion,"" yet even those unencumbered by fiscal considerations treat it with respect. The dining room is dominated by the striking porcelain-tiled chandeliers hanging from the soaring ceiling. If you're on one of the raised tables you get to look down-literally rather than patronizingly-onto your fellow diners through the neo-classical arches. Yet thanks to the personable service, the grandeur of the room never stifles the animated atmosphere. The cooking is as sophisticated as the surroundings and the ingredients come from the top drawer. The kitchen has had an obvious classical education yet you never feel it is tied by the tyranny of tradition. Just order the succulent Niman Ranch lamb chops and you'll find them accompanied with quinoa mixed with avocado. Occasionally, over-enthusiastic garnishing can overawe the dish's main ingredient but there's no doubting this is a very capable kitchen.	","[

Tori Shin,362 W. 53rd St. 10019, Japanese,"When the city's best yakitori decided to up and relocate, its Upper East Side neighborhood suffered a crushing culinary loss-one that would soon become midtown's gain. And after a long construction, Tori Shin is finally welcoming both fresh and familiar faces to its brand-new Hell's Kitchen home. A small bar pouring sake, shochu, and Japanese whiskey welcomes patrons into a multi-level dining room where table seating is now offered in abundance-including a clutch of options in a mezzanine room with gorgeous gold leaf walls. Boasting 500-year old hinoki and a serene palette of sand and stone, this is an upscale, sophisticated spin on the original location. What hasn't changed, however, is the quality of the organically raised chicken parts and the expert skill in which they are sizzled over the binchotan-fired grill. Skewers of crisped wing, seared heart, and creamy liver need nothing more than a few grains of salt to express true flavor. Ordering à la carte is a fun way to explore the menu, which offers grilled vegetables and items like chicken cha-shu in addition to omakase-a succulent onslaught of kara-age, chicken and duck tsukune, blistered shisito peppers, and soboro don.

Sit at the communal table with a hefty pour of a rare wine (ask about specials), and gaze at the tunnel-like dining room, crafted to mimic a barrel and clothed with Vik Muniz photographs of abstract wine spills. The wine-centric motif is as clear as the glassware. While their array of sips are winning, meat and cheese boards are equally worthy, thanks to the genius of Gilles Verot. He's responsible for the award-winning fromage de tête (bright and clean in flavor). The rest of the menu is as infallible and includes everything from Provençal rabbit to the Île flottante.	","[

The menu here is light yet dense with bright flavor, from the crudo du jour (perhaps cubes of hamachi with gently braised cauliflower, pignoli, white raisins, and herbs) to a tender octopus salad with Marcona almonds, arugula, and Jerez vinegar. Huge morsels of chicken with cous cous, wilted greens, and preserved lemons make a hearty dish, attractively served in a classic tagine vessel.	","[

The chefs perform in their display kitchen behind a glass screen, but instead of offering a generic menu they choose a different region each month and then showcase its specialities and best known ingredients. So come in, say, May and it could be Sardinia when you can have malloreddus as a pasta course or some mosciame with your linguine. The cooking is robust and generously proportioned, although the care and craftsmanship of previous years is no longer evident.	","[

The waitstaff is professional, not overly formal, and genuinely interested in each guest. Classic American elegance shines in a menu that effortlessly balances technique, ingredients, and flavor in perfect measure, while remaining creative and never predictable. Don't miss signature dishes like the lobster Bolognese, served as a whole tail or claws over a massive twirl of beautifully cooked spaghetti with finely chopped lobster meat in a light shallot-garlic-tomato broth that ensures the sauce melds with each bite. A gorgeous fillet of butter-poached turbot, which arrives alongside roasted winter squash made fragrant and sweet with allspice, is then finished with a decadent touch of caviar. The peanut butter and chocolate-gianduja crémeux is a perennial highlight.	","[

The crowd is lively yet sophisticated-whether seated at the date-friendly bar, pleasant glass atrium, or brick dining room decorated with memorable bullfighting scenes. Like its surrounds, this noteworthy cuisine arrives much more beautiful than expected-clearly there is modern talent in Chef Manuel Berganza's kitchen. While the chef's creative expression has been met with mixed results of late, each dish can at its best be composed with an eye on innovative cooking as well as classic flavors. Here, Catalan pork sausage is interestingly composed with shaved fennel and a fava bean casserole to elevate each bite. Then, pristine sardines are wrapped around pan con tomate and set over a bed of picada-style sauce for good flavor. Likewise, berenjenas asada is appealingly complex, served as cubed and puréed eggplant, balanced by a honey- and red wine-vinegar reduction. Simple-sounding mushroom croquettes combined with barely pickled mushrooms are gloriously earthy.	","[

Linen-draped tables, spacious banquettes, and big windows facing Second Avenue fashion a look that inspires dressing up (or not). Service is always gracious, if at times earnest. The kitchen shines with its eggplant halim, a creamy, steaming roasted eggplant and onion dip with tender lentils and a dollop of yogurt on top. A kebab duo of saffron-tinged chicken and grilled beef are both succulent successes, served with basmati rice flecked with bits of sour cherry. For dessert, try the tart-sweet Persian lemon ice studded with bits of rice noodles and doused in deep red cherry syrup.	","[

This demure space feels tidy and neutral beneath colorful ceiling pendants and wine shelves. A polite staff attends to the familiar coterie of neighborhood patrons. The menu specializes in regional dishes that are spiced to your desired level. Sample rich bowls of keema matar, a thick and meaty stew of minced lamb and sweet peas in a spicy curry paste of dried red chilies, ginger, coriander, and cloves. Hearty vegetarian options include paneer makhani, brimming with cubes of diced house-made cheese in a decadent cream and butter-enriched tomato sauce; or lusciously seasoned and distinctly tart vegetable vindaloo stocked with cauliflower, potatoes, and sweet carrots.

Tanoshi's pristine piscine selection will reveal an enticing bounty. Items can be as simple as a piece of deep ocean sea bream brushed with soy sauce and touched with sea salt, or as dressed up as a salt- and vinegar-cured branzini topped with sweet pickled white kelp and marinated cherry leaf. Five-second-poached Hokkaido sea scallops and salmon roe marinated for 48-hours in soy, honey, and sake may fall somewhere in between courses and are quite excellent.	","[

The slender setting is adorned with silk-lined walls, sleek leather seating, and evocative artwork. The well-dressed staff is serious, but their hospitality is genuine. The team of highly experienced co-chefs is equally intense in turning out their skilled cooking. Antipasti might include an elegant, warm octopus salad with baby artichoke and crispy potatoes, while heartier options may feature house-made cavatelli with jumbo crabmeat and sea urchin. Lunch offers a more pared-down experience, but a bowlful of velvety pasta e fagioli stocked with plump borlotti beans is a perfect post-shopping tonic.	","[

Drinks are steadily churned out at a dark wood bar, so arrive early to avoid the hordes. The focus at this multi-generational saloon is the burger-perhaps paired with a lip-smacking Bloody Mary at brunch?

Be forewarned: you will go through the entire stack of napkins before finishing. Other simple pleasures include standards like salads, steaks, and eggs.

The simple space offers three rows of tables, unadorned white walls, and a well-lit counter in the rear, and is warmed up by enthusiastic servers. Devoted customers know the draw here is not atmosphere, but the quality and excellent value omakase. Fish can be surprisingly luscious, especially the salmon, which has a remarkably clean finish and great salty note. The medium fatty tuna needs nothing more than a kiss of soy sauce. A 12-course omakase might also include giant clam, uni, sea eel, fluke, smelt roe, and for dessert, tamago. The kanto soba is excellent too, with a rich soy-bonito broth with scallions, seaweed, and a fish cake.	","[

Boathouse Central Park,Loeb Boathouse, American,"The word ""touristy"" is mostly used pejoratively but there's no denying that sometimes visitors to the city know a good thing when they see one. Loeb Boathouse was built in 1954 and includes an outdoor bar and a restaurant whose glass wall folds away in the summer to give every table a great view of the lake. If you want to swap the chaos of the city and its cacophony of car horns for a couple of tranquil hours, then here's where to come. The menu is a mix of American and European classics alongside less successful dishes of a more innovative persuasion. Try the robustly seasoned linguine with Little Neck clams or Scottish salmon with chickpea purée. While brunch and lunch are year-long affairs, dinner is only served during warmer months.	","[

Orsay proves its dedication to French tradition from the sidewalk seating to marble stairs leading up to a private room. Chef Antoine Camin's cheese soufflés sustain much of the well-dressed crowd here, but the classic menu brings much more. Soupe de poisson is a richly satisfying fusion of fish, tomatoes, fennel, and herbs; brook trout is presented à la Grenobloise with browned butter, capers, and finely diced croutons; and roasted pork tenderloin arrives with savoy cabbage, apples, and hard cider sauce. The soaked baba au rhum is as fine a rendition as any à Paris.	","[

Café Boulud,20 E. 76th St. 10021, French,"Taking its cue from classic French cuisine, Daniel Boulud's refined vision of food and beverage at the Surrey hotel is comprised of two spaces: the jewel box known as Bar Pleiades and this elegant, appealingly understated restaurant. Inside, ritzy residents and in-the-know globetrotters dine in a well-groomed, secluded room furnished with plush carpeting, rich wood accents, and mirrored surfaces. Sparkling elements atop beautifully laid tables set off the spot's conviviality, and gallant, smartly-dressed servers display unwavering competence in their presentation of uniquely constructed and superb tasting compositions. Under the watch of Chef Aaron Bludorn, the kitchen makes culinary decisions that never disappoint. Classically done poulet rôti showcases evenly moist, crispy skinned chicken finished with a fragrant tarragon jus, while the Crescent Farms Pekin duck, cooked to a perfect pink and sprinkled with coarse salt, is served with currant-studded kasha for wonderful depth in flavor and texture. For dessert, intricately layered crêpe cakes are garnished with rhubarb gelée and kissed with ricotta sorbet. And warm and springy madeleines-a house signature-send satisfied diners on their way.

Hints of sriracha and ginger keep things bright in bigeye tuna tartare, served in a glass jar glistening with sesame oil and avocado. Soft tacos filled with spicy shrimp and pineapple pico de gallo or red-miso Atlantic cod are filling and light at once. Brunch is a hit with twists on traditional fare.

Sushi of Gari,402 E. 78th St. 10021, Japanese,"Great things come in unassuming packages-such is the case at Sushi of Gari, where the handsome, but decidedly unflashy décor belies a transporting omakase experience. Sold? A few insider tips from the regulars and you're on your way: make your reservation weeks in advance, as the dining room stays quite booked; score a seat only at the sushi counter, not just to enjoy those freshly scored slices of sushi straight from the chef's hand, but also because the congenial vibe at the bar surpasses the somewhat rushed experience at the tables; and do keep an eye on those prices, which can add up quicker than a trip to Target. Sushi of Gari is Chef Masatoshi ""Gari"" Sugio's flagship restaurant, and the legendary chef's trademark creativity and skill shine in spades here. A night indulging in his omakase might include delicately seared kanpachi, topped with a lightly poached quail egg; wildly fresh Japanese red snapper paired with pine nuts, bright greens, and fried lotus root; tender, seared toro with garlic and ginger sauce; or perfectly poached yellowtail, laced with sesame sauce and a sprinkle of chives. Sound too good to wait for a reservation? Sushi of Gari also offers a booming takeout service.	","[

Dovetail,103 W. 77th St. 10024, American,"Serious but never pretentious, Dovetail is a well-frequented culinary destination. Don't be duped by its slight façade, as the seriously overhauled space within now feels much more spacious, ultra-warm, and very chic. Then consider the delightfully accommodating and well-orchestrated staff only to find that it all comes together in perfect harmony. Menus are handsomely bound in leather and highlight remarkably unique, ingredient-focused treats like a chickpea panisse coupled with garlicky aïoli; wedges of cool and tender chayote topped with crunchy pumpkin seeds and a creamy pumpkin purée; or king trumpet mushrooms coasting alongside paper-thin shavings of Asian pear, finished with an earthy and silky sunchoke paste. One large and plump potato raviolo, filled with creamy herb-flecked ricotta and floating in a pool of potato foam, is topped with a deep-fried sage leaf, which in turn makes for an ideal counterpoint to the rich layer beneath. Feeling self-righteous after such a wonderfully wholesome feast? You may look forward to some good old-fashioned decadence by way of a bittersweet chocolate soufflé-very light, delightfully frothy, and enriched with just the right dab of cardamom-cocoa nib ice cream.

Yefsi,"1481 York Ave., New York, NY 10075", Greek,"Chef Christos Christou brings a wealth of experience to the kitchen of this Yorkville standout. Having manned the stoves at some of the city's Greek stalwarts, the Cyprus-native knows his way around his Aegean and Mediterranean coastal specialties. Begin with salads showcasing superb feta or explore the array of luscious meze including zucchini and eggplant chips with tzatziki, octopus braised in mavrodafni or wine-spiked tomato sauce, and grilled sausages over black-eyed peas. Entrées entice with freshness and flavor, such as the wow-inducing nightly special of grilled tiger shrimp. Served head-on and lobster-like in size and texture, they are accompanied by a mound of creamy spinach rice and squeeze of fresh lemon-the perfect embellishment.	","[

Quatorze Bis,323 E. 79th St. 10021, French,"Savoring a meal at this ever-lovely bistro is like taking a break from the constant evolution that is life in New York City, where tastes change faster than you can tweet. The red-lacquer façade, claret-velvet banquettes, and sophisticated clientele are all much the same as when Quatorze Bis opened almost 25 years ago. Though the ambience's timeless appeal is noteworthy, the traditional French cooking is their key to success. Frilly chicory, drizzled with hot bacon fat and red wine vinegar, and pocked with lardons, croutons, and shallots makes for a very hearty, très French salad. Seafood sausage is plump and studded with sweet red pepper and pine nuts. Daily specials keep the menu new, with dishes like striped bass served beside a creamy sorrel sauce.	","[

The facelift has revealed a more casual vibe-no tablecloths-but the scene is just about as casual as Upper East Siders can stomach. Inlaid geometric patterned flooring and an earthy palette remain, while a mural of the Côte d' Or is an attractive new touch signaling a more serious approach to wine. Rooftop greens as well as bread and gelato made in-house at the market factor into the revised menu that boasts a sunny disposition in its affection for the Mediterranean. Expect to enjoy pig's ear salad with a mustard vinaigrette, plump sardines over olive oil-smashed potatoes, or fresh pappardelle twirled with wild mushrooms and a bit of cream.	","[

Other choices include burritos served with sweet potato fries, refreshing salads in crisp tostadas, and black beans with quinoa.

Vibrant flavors enhanced by garlic and herbs start with chilled platters loaded with hummus, mashed eggplant spread (patlican salatasi), and salads like kisir, tabbouleh made with cracked wheat. The only other thing you'll need to fully enjoy the Beyoglu experience is a bowl of strained, house-made yogurt. That flatbread is pulled straight from the hot oven only to arrive on your table seconds later, gratis and absolutely gratifying. Tile-topped tables and pistachio-green walls displaying painted flowers accent the interior. French doors separate the dining room from the sidewalk, but during warm weather both areas fill quickly.

This good-looker's founding husband-and-wife chef team are no longer involved, but the kitchen remains steady in the hands of Chef Joseph d'Angelo, who turns out classic cuisine with a Mediterranean accent. Slices of marinated fluke dabbed with lavender-hued Kalamata olive aïoli is a bracing crudo of the day.

Service has lightened up of late, reflected in the genuine smiles of the small and gracious crew, but the cuisine's ethos remains very much unaltered.

B. Café West,"566 Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10024", Belgian,"Discover a slice of Belgium at this Upper West charmer, where the space may be narrow and deep, but the front bar is always in full swing at happy hour. The dining room is slightly elevated and very warm thanks to cozy bistro-style tables covered in white linen, a pressed-tin ceiling, and beaming waiters. Posters and brass accents verge on cliché but all misgivings are pardoned upon tasting their fine and familiar favorites. Start with numerous moules options like delicious Malay laksa (red curry), Pamplona (chorizo), or red Duvel with hot sauce. Crunch your way through beer-battered fish and frites, before savoring a seafood ostendaise finished with shallots and cream. Gaufre de Bruxelles drizzled with chocolate sauce is fit for a Belgian queen.	","[

Il Salumaio,"1731 2nd Ave., New York, NY 10028", Italian,"Yorkville residents have been doubly blessed by Fabio and Ciro Casella. First, their pizzeria San Matteo arrived on the scene with its wood-fired specialties. Now, the brothers bring more delightfully rustic fare by way of primo panini and pastas, to this underserved neighborhood. The slender space seats only a handful, but sidewalk tables increase the accommodations. Cured meats and imported cheeses temptingly stocked in a refrigerator display case are skillfully manifested atop luscious plates like the Arthur Avenue-basically a panino bursting with ham, salume, mortadellla, and provolone. The paccheri all'Amatriciana or fat tubes of perfectly cooked pasta in a thick tomato ragù seasoned with onion, pancetta and pecorino Romano, is a delight unto itself.	","[

Boasting top-shelf Belgian and American beers as well as a clubby vibe, this unpretentious steakhouse seems to have it all...including space. Dine here-there's even elbow room for the classically large portions of high-quality beef. Meat really stands out as does the expert seasoning. Find evidence of this in hand-cut steak tartare, tossed with pickled onions, mustard, and gherkins topped with rye croutons. Served over sweet potato purée with smoked bacon and caramelized onions, the garlicky, herb-crusted Berkshire pork chop is a culmination of divine flavors. Cheesecake crowned with candied pecans and caramel sauce offers an extravagant yet excellent finale.	","[

The room is graciously attended to and perpetually crowded with neighborhood folks stuffing their faces.

Despite the continuing construction along Second Avenue, a devoted following still seeks out this favored neighborhood pizzeria. Begin with the spinach salad slicked with hot bacon fat and red wine vinegar before enjoying a thin-crusted but tender and nicely chewy pie, decked with the likes of fennel sausage crumbles, crushed tomatoes, creamy mozzarella, and sweet basil.

Come early or risk waiting, which isn't so bad considering the bar, whose by-the-glass offerings are vast and very appealing with both familiar and unusual Italian choices. The menu can be overwhelming considering its long list of pastas and daily specials, so trust your gut and you can't go wrong. Start with the polenta, served almost quattro stagione-style, with gorgonzola, prosciutto, and sliced portobellos; before twirling your taste buds around chewy bucatini showered with pecorino and pepper. The tiramisu is a light, creamy, and fluffy slam dunk.	","[

The décor follows suit with a butcher-block table, white wainscoting, dark walls, and wide, comfortable tables. The kitchen promises a focus on carefully sourced organic and biodynamic ingredients-the kind that Granny used. (Evidently, their foremothers had access to quinoa and excellent feta.) Cobb salad is a pitch-perfect combination of grilled chicken, bacon, blue cheese, and more in a creamy dressing.

Executive Chef/partner Neil Kleinberg (also of downtown fave Clinton St. Baking Company) turns out joyful fare, and the weekly blueberry pancake special is just one reason why this place gets so much love. For lunch, a kale salad with artichoke hearts, pickled carrots, and crispy chickpeas is anything but rote. Come dinnertime, the fish or steak of the day has revealed pan-seared mahi-mahi with roasted cauliflower and black truffle beurre blanc, or grilled strip steak brushed with glistening teriyaki.	","[

Nocciola,237 E. 116th St. 10029, Italian,"The transformation of this East Harlem address into a pleasing trattoria is a breath of fresh air for the neighborhood. Run by the team behind El Paso, the slender space has been minimally re-touched but nevertheless feels cozy and inviting with its dark-stained wood furnishings and warm brown-shaded walls. The menu boasts house-made pastas like silken fettuccine treated to a soaking of Domenico sugo-a hearty amalgam of sweet fennel sausage, pan-fried spicy meatballs, and pork ragù in a bright tomato sauce. A roasted whole fish is beautifully done, expertly de-boned and dressed with a touch of salmoriglio, charred lemon and young arugula. Top off this confident cooking with a block of classic tiramisu that boasts an ample dusting of cocoa powder.	","[

Carol's Cafe,"1571 Richmond Rd., New York, NY 10304", American,"Dining here is like dining in Chef/owner Carol Frazzetta's kitchen-almost literally, because she lives on the premises. Her delightful personality fills the space, from the fresh flowers and pink linens, to shareable dishes and that homemade chocolate stout triple layer cake. Not only has Frazzetta owned the building since the 1970s, but she clearly knows her neighbors, many of whom flock to the café for a roster of daily specials (top hits include ""wild game of the day"" like grilled buffalo ribeye and a marvelous prosciutto- and tomato-stuffed bread). The chef's slow-cooked spaghetti al pomodoro is another fan fave, topped with a chiffonade of basil and peppered with parmesan, before serving. Like everything else, it's simple, well-made, and delizioso.	","[

New Leaf Café,"1 Margaret Corbin Dr., New York, NY 10040", American,"Located in a 1930s mansion designed by the Olmstead brothers, New Leaf Café was opened as part of the New York Restoration Project. The inside feels like a large cottage with stone walls and arched windows. Alfresco lunch on the flagstone terrace showcases this high, hilly setting with unparalleled views of the Palisades (squint to find the George Washington Bridge). The American menu features a fried risotto cake with gooey mozzarella over Tokyo turnips and sweet pea coulis; or a hunk of seared tuna with tiny mushroom-filled ravioli. Profiteroles are a particular treat, filled with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with luscious chocolate sauce. The gorgeous surrounds and jazz concerts make this a sought-after spot for private events after sun down.	","[

Roberto's,"603 Crescent Ave., New York, NY 10458", Italian,"You can't miss Roberto's, whose distinctive design falls somewhere between a cozy, welcoming farmhouse and a Mediterranean villa complete with a coral-hued façade and wrought-iron balcony. One of the most highly regarded restaurants in the borough, this storied Italian-American is the kind of charmer that makes groups feel right at home. It's also the kind of place that piles on the pasta and takes espresso seriously, whether it's the fettuccine special that features fresh shaved truffle, the soft-shell crabs finished in a butter-white wine sauce, or the ricotta cream that fills an insanely good cannoli. For a real taste of what makes Roberto's shine, let the hearty tubettini con polipo e fave, folded with grilled octopus, fava beans, and baby clams speak for itself.	","[

Take Root,"187 Sackett St., Brooklyn 11231", Contemporary,"If you're lucky enough to score one of the precious few seats here, make it your mission to arrive on time. The tasting menu's procession begins promptly, so stragglers run the risk of missing out on its first luscious bites-and to deprive yourself of a crunchy fennel pollen-dusted potato croquette would be nothing short of a culinary crime. Since this is strictly a two-woman operation, the military-like precision is easily forgiven. Chef Elise Kornack single-handedly runs the immaculate kitchen while her wife, Anna Hieronimus, congenially attends to the tranquil, intimate dining room. But, the team works in tandem when it comes to presenting the uniquely composed plates. Substitutes are not offered, but there's little chance you won't be happy with what's to come. Black garlic-glazed lamb's tongue anticucho is a stimulating opening act for a refreshing summertime composition of slivered snap peas, intensely flavorful tomato pulp, wild ginger, and a creamy drizzle of chocolate mint purée. The chef's style is a fresh and light approach to quality product as seen in asparagus dressed with oysters whipped into a froth or roasted local pork plated with diced celtuce and wild strawberries.

Semilla,"160 Havemeyer St., No. 5, Brooklyn 11211", Contemporary,"Vegetables bask in the spotlight at this stellar South Williamsburg counter, where the formidable team of Chefs José Ramírez-Ruiz and Pamela Yung apply their fine dining aptitude to produce an improvisational feast out of the season's bounty. Turning the notion of service on its head, members of the kitchen step away from their stations to deliver their intricate compositions-each of them plated on hand thrown pottery. The briefest of descriptions is offered upon presentation, which means that a mouthful of ""grilled squash,"" for example, might also deliver raw slivers of pattypan, creamy peanut sauce, and a dusting of dried mint. Embellishments like foie gras and trout roe are used sparingly and to splendid effect, never outshining the true flavor of the produce. Semilla's bread is house-made, excellent, and used to accentuate the menu; as seen in a wedge of flax seed-barley sourdough with cultured butter to accompany a roasted carrot ""mille-feuille,"" alongside smoked potato purée and fava-greens sauce. Although the duo of sweets to finish may include options that disappoint, dessert can also be an electrifying success as in the egg yolk-saffron sorbet, cloud of smoked cream, and passion fruit.	","[

The River Café,"1 Water St., Brooklyn 11201", Contemporary,"Thanks to its enviable location and stunning skyline vistas, this waterside favorite more than lives up to its reputation as one of the dreamiest escapes in town. Delicate details like fresh, fragrant flowers, beautifully set tables, and cozy rattan chairs make for romantic environs-and though the tight space has a way of turning intimate whispers into public displays of affection, all will be forgiven after a bite or two of Chef Brad Steelman's solid-as-ever cuisine. Launch into plump wild shrimp smothered in creamy Hollandaise and served with crunchy white asparagus for added texture; or the perfectly crisped crab cake arranged with creamy uni, avocado, and a light herb salad. Pearly white halibut with roasted maitakes is a testament to the kitchen's focus on simplicity and supreme freshness, while a glistening rack of mint- and mustard seed-glazed lamb-charred on the outside with an evenly pink interior-exemplifies its artistry. Enjoy dessert, as the mouthwatering offerings (think milk chocolate soufflé with melted marshmallow, or dark chocolate marquise topped with a replica of the nearby Brooklyn Bridge) are a veritable education in soigné presentations and sumptuous flavors.

Pok Pok Ny,"117 Columbia St., Brooklyn 11231", Thai,"Foodies flock to this penultimate scene not for the vibe, but for a profound understanding of Isaan culinary traditions. If pok pok means ""mortar and pestle"" then Chef Andy Ricker makes this utensil the foundation of his trademark cooking, which takes excellent local product and imparts it with American flair. The spacious room, outfitted with salvaged wood and exposed brick walls, is filled with a Brooklyn crowd. The kitchen has struggled with turnover and while some dishes remain solid as ever, others can disappoint. Top-quality boar collar coated in a flavorful rub of soy sauce, sugar, and spice is seared to chewy perfection before being coupled with cool mustard greens. Superb execution and pronounced flavors are clear in khanom jiin kaeng khiaw waan luuk chin plae, a tart and texturally exquisite green coconut curry floating with delicate fish balls and garnished with fried anchovies for unbeatable texture; and sai ua samun phrai or grilled Thai sausage accompanied by a spicy eggplant sauce, crispy pork cracklings, and a bouquet of long beans. Seal the deal with affogato-a shot of espresso poured over decadent condensed milk ice cream, which ensures nothing but sweet dreams.	","[

The patio dining room is where fashionistas nestle like pretty young things on button-tufted banquettes amid bunches of pink roses and flickering votives. A retractable glass roof shields the attractive Brazilian walnut floors and limestone walls from outside elements.The Spanish cuisine of Chef Luis Bollo, a native of San Sebastián, sparkles with coastal influences. Tapas are muy creative and include boquerones over delicate toast strips spread with smashed avocado. The fideos negros y crujientes is an ink-stained mound of toasted vermicelli, cuttlefish, and aïoli foam grandly stirred together upon presentation.	","[

Blanca,"261 Moore St., Brooklyn 11206", Contemporary,"Tucked deep into the Roberta's compound-that den of restaurant cool that helped elevate seedy Bushwick into a legitimately haute food 'hood-lays this gleaming warehouse kitchen aimed at the serious eater. If you're lucky enough to snag a seat at Blanca, you'll make your way first into Roberta's lively, corrugated metal-facade, past the delicious smell of their wood-burning pizza oven and sound of vinyl records playing the blues, and through the buzzing outdoor garden. Can this many tattooed urbanites and Millennials know something you don't? Indeed. Blanca's interior is sleek and minimal, with a pristine white counter lined with cognac leather stools positioned to watch the chefs create each dish. Chef Carlo Mirarchi's nightly 20-course menu is never published beforehand, nor does the restaurant take any dietary accommodations into account. The message is loud and clear: trust us and we'll delight your senses. And delight it does as dinner might begin with deep orange lobes of sea urchin dusted with coarse sea salt and a tiny dollop of warm polenta. Then move on to impeccably fresh sliced fluke in almond water and plum vinegar, topped with fennel fronds; or tender ravioli fat with spicy 'nduja and laced with zesty grated orange.	","[
