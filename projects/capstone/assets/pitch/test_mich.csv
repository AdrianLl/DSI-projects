MICHELIN Guide

			It is a family affair at this pleasant restaurant perched on the Pointe de Penmarch. The chef and his son-in-law work in tandem. Seafood ingredients dominate, with fish sourced from the local inshore industry, carefully prepared and nicely presented on the plate.

MICHELIN Guide

			The sweet smells wafting from the kitchen leave no doubt... this restaurant, run by a charming couple, honours good cooking. An adept of locavorism, the chef favours ingredients from the region, including meat from Limousin, of course. What is more, they offer a good choice of wines by the glass and the decor is tasteful and modern.
