	Salinas
",Cuisine Spanish,"
			Salinas is undeniably sexy. Step beyond the wrought-iron gates and squeeze your way past the bar to find the dusky scene. The patio dining room is where fashionistas nestle like pretty young things on button-tufted banquettes amid bunches of pink roses and flickering votives. A retractable glass roof shields the attractive Brazilian walnut floors and limestone walls from outside elements.The Spanish cuisine of Chef Luis Bollo, a native of San Sebastián, sparkles with coastal influences. Tapas are muy creative and include boquerones over delicate toast strips spread with smashed avocado. The fideos negros y crujientes is an ink-stained mound of toasted vermicelli, cuttlefish, and aïoli foam grandly stirred together upon presentation.

	Colonie
",Cuisine Contemporary,"
			Hip and lively (both the crowd and the green wall of lush plants that is), this is a buzzing retreat for taking in all that makes Brooklyn so enticing. There is the exposed brick dining room and the ceilings of distressed wood, of course, along with the requisite long bar and perhaps most important, a sharp crowd who give Colonie its measured dose of cool. Start with crostini, perhaps laden with egg salad, a ribbon of lardo and drizzle of veal jus. A deeply nutty rye berry ragout brings together crispy mushrooms, cabbage, and a perfectly fried duck egg. Opt for the whole market fish, served deboned with tart and herbaceous salsa verde, crisp garlic, and roasted lemon. Be sure to save room for warm, yeasty sugar donuts stuffed with Chantilly cream.

	Sottocasa
",Cuisine Pizza,"
			Located just below street level on frenetic Atlantic Avenue, a nondescript façade holds a quiet den of serious Neapolitan pizza magic. Enter and you'll find a simple, narrow, wood-paneled room with whitewashed brick walls; a little bar showcasing a handful of wines; an enormous, two-ton clay oven (imported directly from Naples); and a little patio out back for alfresco dining. The mood is decidedly relaxed, and while there are delicious salads, antipasti, and desserts to be tried at Sottocasa, the name of the game here is undoubtedly their wickedly good pizza, served folded, blanche or rosse (with-hurrah!-a gluten-free option as well). Regulars adore the Diavola pie, which comes laced with excellent mozzarella, fresh basil, black olives, and hot sopressata.

	Hibino
",Cuisine Japanese,"
			The team at this demure retreat isn't constrained by a menu. Instead, diners are greeted by servers bearing blackboards that list the day's offerings. The list of obanzai (Kyoto-style tapas) are enticing and include marinated, fried chicken thigh with tartar sauce, grilled pork sausage, or roasted oysters with spicy gazpacho. The kitchen's regional dedication is also evident in its offering of Osaka's traditional hako sushi. This box-pressed preparation might be served as a layering of quality rice, shiso, kanpyo (preserved gourd), and salmon. Meanwhile, lunch is a concise affair that reveals either a bento box or platter of nigiri accompanied by a neatly stuffed futomaki. Of course, if lunch seems limited, come back for dinner when the kitchen truly shines.

	Ki Sushi

			Smith Street offers plenty of dining option to choose from, but Ki is this strip's sushi standout. Low-key and proffering good value, it is also a neighborhood favorite. At lunch, find downtown Brooklyn professionals taking a respite from the day's proceedings. At night, young couples and families routinely pack the room that brandishes a dim and earthy mien. Sample an array of cold and hot appetizers like yellowtail tartare with yuzu-ginger vinaigrette or rock shrimp tempura with creamy-spicy sauce. Follow this with creative maki, or better yet, the sushi deluxe platter. The skillfully constructed nigiri lineup features an array of fluke, sea bream, amberjack, and mackerel, as well as a roll stuffed with lean and deliciously unadulterated tuna.

			From the team behind Buttermilk Channel, French Louie combines a candlelit vibe with rustic touches and a dominantly Mediterranean menu in a welcoming setting that's become the neighborhood hideaway. Whether you perch at the mahogany bar or in the spacious backyard, be sure to come hungry for the splurge-worthy cheese plate and profiteroles-golden, puffy and encapsulating a fennel pollen-flavored ice cream. For a dish to share, try the Le Grand Socca, not normally found outside Liguria (where's it's called farinata) or the South of France. A bit thicker than the traditional, this pizza-sized crêpe arrives topped with a shelled-bean stew, charred asparagus, freekeh, and spiced lemon yogurt, with just the right amount of smokiness from the skillet.

	Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare
",Cuisine Contemporary,"
			At 7:00 P.M. this storefront attached to a gourmet grocer turns into something conceptual and remarkable. Here, Chef César Ramirez-the bespectacled authoritarian-stands center stage, surrounded by sous chefs and state-of-the-art everything. He personally welcomes every guest to his ""table"" which is actually a gleaming steel counter surrounding his kitchen, where each copper pot is watched-over and every porcelain vessel is cooled or warmed to match the temperature of the food it holds. The bar for painstaking detail seems to rise with each dish. Expect a bang of flavor to open your meal, perhaps with a tart layering briny sea trout roe. Signatures like sea urchin piled over toasted brioche with a round of Périgord truffle never lose their impact. However, what was once an endless parade of seafood bites from faraway shores has grown and refined into equally lush mini-entrées. A square of Miyagi beef is whoa-inducing. Tiny wild strawberries, yogurt ice cream, and sake gelée balance each element with wondrous intensity. The menu changes every night, but Chef Ramirez never veers from his brilliant melding of French and Japanese cuisines with modern style that keeps pleasure at the forefront.

			Boerum Hill's most bodacious deli serves up killer smoked meat and so much more. The tiny space gets lots of traffic, and those who can't find a seat along the counter or trio of communal tables can feast at home with takeout procured from the sidewalk window. Now for the food: a cured and smoked brisket sandwich, stacked onto soft rye bread and smacked with mustard, is the stuff that dreams are made of. Eclectic and vegetarian-friendly, the menu also reveals poutine (owner Noah Bernamoff is a Montreal native), roasted eggplant brik dotted with briny capers, pine nuts, and sweet raisins; as well as fresh-baked desserts like almond cake with house-made vanilla ice cream. Manhattanites take heed: there's a location now on Bond Street.

			Set in quiet and charming Cobble Hill, La Vara is as alluring as its surrounds. Inside, hip urbanites get down to business around the sleek marble bar; while stroller-rolling parents might migrate to curved leather booths or nestle in the wooden alcoves up front. In the main dining room, white tables set with contemporary crockery offer just the right contrast to rustic brick walls. From soft lighting and personable service, to countrified food and inventive presentations, this convivial respite never misses a beat. Embark on a journey to culinary heights with the visually strange but wonderful tasting remojón featuring a scoop of house-cured salt cod mingled with orange segments, pistachios, and sliced green olives. Then, sail on to fideuà or Valencian-style noodle paella tossed with fresh, briny clams, tender squid, and a creamy aïoli. With luck on your side, cochinillo (slow-cooked, amber-hued suckling pig with crackling skin and rose-quince sauce) or tortillita de gambas accompanied by a pale pink shrimp pâté may star on the menu. If not, rest easy as you can still have your cake (or in this case an orange blossom-scented walnut tart finished with lemon curd and cream) and eat it too.

			Although the name evokes a swinging place with cocktails and conversation, Sociale proves much more than a neighborhood social club. With true Italian hospitality and a cozy corner location across from a throw-back cinema, Sociale has become the Brooklyn Heights spot to spend a lively Friday night. Regulars wedge up to the bar for glasses of mineral-rich Italian whites or crowd into a charming, lair-like dining room, where the table inches away from yours may host your newest companion. The menu sticks to classics, with perfectly cooked spaghetti in fresh and chunky pomodoro sauce; or veal loin wrapped in pancetta and drizzled with great veal jus. Come dessert, the banana and date bread pudding with Guinness gelato is absolutely delicious.

Nightly specials are deftly executed, including a Mongolian lamb ramen in chili-sansho broth topped with slices of lamb, fried onions, garlic chives, and ajitama egg.

Exposed brick walls covered with old-fashioned clocks set a cozy tone, and regulars return for the well-stocked bar with myriad bitters and a bargain three-course prix-fixe. Slurp a few bivalves at the Oyster Room next door before settling into a table, or if thirst beckons, sip an Old Fashioned with barrel strength Bourbon while perusing the menu. Some locals head straight for the burger-focaccia layered with Gruyère, caramelized Bourbon onions, and a juicy beef patty.

Yogurt and granola with local honey is part of the kitchen's repertoire, but the restaurant's Northern Italian influence fully comes into focus in the evenings.

The glossy mahogany bar (furnished with leather-upholstered bar stools) is overseen by natty bartenders artfully shaking and pouring a stellar selection of libations like the namesake Clover Club-a mixture of gin, dry vermouth, lemon, and raspberry syrup. An excellent savory carte is a perfect counterpoint to such liquid indulgences. Highlights may include herb-marinated hanger steak over toasted baguette spread with horseradish cream; duck fat-fried potato crisps; oysters on the half-shell; and American caviar service.

Stay on for dinner, because the menu offers plenty of proper options. Smooth asparagus and fennel soup sprinkled with crushed bacon gains its silken texture from puréed red bliss potatoes; while the thick, juicy lamb burger is topped with creamy feta cheese and accompanied by sun-dried tomato ketchup and rosemary salt-tossed French fries.

The spacious room, outfitted with salvaged wood and exposed brick walls, is filled with a Brooklyn crowd. The kitchen has struggled with turnover and while some dishes remain solid as ever, others can disappoint. Top-quality boar collar coated in a flavorful rub of soy sauce, sugar, and spice is seared to chewy perfection before being coupled with cool mustard greens. Superb execution and pronounced flavors are clear in khanom jiin kaeng khiaw waan luuk chin plae, a tart and texturally exquisite green coconut curry floating with delicate fish balls and garnished with fried anchovies for unbeatable texture; and sai ua samun phrai or grilled Thai sausage accompanied by a spicy eggplant sauce, crispy pork cracklings, and a bouquet of long beans.

			If you're lucky enough to score one of the precious few seats here, make it your mission to arrive on time. The tasting menu's procession begins promptly, so stragglers run the risk of missing out on its first luscious bites-and to deprive yourself of a crunchy fennel pollen-dusted potato croquette would be nothing short of a culinary crime. Since this is strictly a two-woman operation, the military-like precision is easily forgiven. Chef Elise Kornack single-handedly runs the immaculate kitchen while her wife, Anna Hieronimus, congenially attends to the tranquil, intimate dining room. But, the team works in tandem when it comes to presenting the uniquely composed plates. Substitutes are not offered, but there's little chance you won't be happy with what's to come. Black garlic-glazed lamb's tongue anticucho is a stimulating opening act for a refreshing summertime composition of slivered snap peas, intensely flavorful tomato pulp, wild ginger, and a creamy drizzle of chocolate mint purée. The chef's style is a fresh and light approach to quality product as seen in asparagus dressed with oysters whipped into a froth or roasted local pork plated with diced celtuce and wild strawberries.

Toss in wood tables, inviting counter seating, and dusky blue walls, and you have this enticing pub. Chef Neal Harden has put together a menu of suds-friendly food consisting of vegetarian snacks (think fried hop pickles with preserved lemon aïoli), and salads such as grilled romaine and Tuscan black kale with beluga lentils. Pickle Shack's lighter fare is rounded out by hearty, imaginative sandwiches crafted from local ingredients and purveyors. To that end, order the crusty artisan baguette filled with warm cannellini bean purée, grilled asparagus, and fennel-pickled beets.

			Jacques Gautier is the artiste behind this snug den cooking Latin and Caribbean cuisine. Nestled at the base of a townhouse, the dimly lit room makes for a lively (cue the salsa beats) yet intimate dining experience. Service can be slow, but nobody's in a hurry, so play along and make a night to remember. Closely set tables make privacy a challenge, but the arrival of crave-worthy pork tacos topped with creamy avocado, crunchy radish, and cilantro will keep your eyes on the prize. Find equal appeal in a fillet of roasted fluke set atop pickled purple cabbage, paired with a pineapple-habanero sauce that will make you singe with abandon, and scattered with tart tomatillo salsa. Still have room for more? Continue the feast across the street at Taco Santo.

Bricolage bills itself as a gastropub (and the creative cocktails are certainly fantastic), but make no mistake-this is modern, next-level Vietnamese bar fare. Crispy, golden imperial rolls arrive stuffed with shiny glass noodles, crunchy cabbage, earthy mushrooms, and minced pork; while a dish of ""Unshaking Beef"" is laced in a light, salty-sweet marinade and seared to tender, juicy perfection alongside a peppery watercress salad.

The kitchen seeks out worthy suppliers and with no little skill imbues each dish with that little extra something, be it the cod with Littleneck clams, the fresh linguini with beets or indeed the buttermilk-fried chicken.

A mix of distressed brick walls and sleek tiles fill the dining room, while brass mermaid door handles give the look a playful edge. Art deco-inspired fixtures hang over the inviting bar. Tasso ham lends a smoky hint of the South to chewy mounds of hand-rolled linguini and tender coins of braised octopus tossed with a chunky puttanesca sauce of tomato, olives, capers, and garlic. Silky, organic chicken liver mousse is served alongside a stack of toasted baguette slices and fennel-apple salad. A pot de crème spiked with chilies is a welcome twist on the classic dessert.

			Vegetables bask in the spotlight at this stellar South Williamsburg counter, where the formidable team of Chefs José Ramírez-Ruiz and Pamela Yung apply their fine dining aptitude to produce an improvisational feast out of the season's bounty. Turning the notion of service on its head, members of the kitchen step away from their stations to deliver their intricate compositions-each of them plated on hand thrown pottery. The briefest of descriptions is offered upon presentation, which means that a mouthful of ""grilled squash,"" for example, might also deliver raw slivers of pattypan, creamy peanut sauce, and a dusting of dried mint. Embellishments like foie gras and trout roe are used sparingly and to splendid effect, never outshining the true flavor of the produce. Semilla's bread is house-made, excellent, and used to accentuate the menu; as seen in a wedge of flax seed-barley sourdough with cultured butter to accompany a roasted carrot ""mille-feuille,"" alongside smoked potato purée and fava-greens sauce. Although the duo of sweets to finish may include options that disappoint, dessert can also be an electrifying success as in the egg yolk-saffron sorbet, cloud of smoked cream, and passion fruit.

For the fish-free, a raw vegan kelp noodle-pad Thai is remarkably satisfying.

			Entering through this (now) iconic red door is like a trip through the looking glass and into Bushwick's foodie wonderland. The city's love affair with Roberta's seems stronger each year, and for good reason. Everything from the industrial space to the underground Bohemian vibe epitomizes Brooklyn-chic. A new takeaway option has been added to the compound, so when the wait for a table is too long, snag a porchetta sandwich to-go. Queens native Carlo Mirarchi leads a talented kitchen and its menu of beautifully prepared pasta, vegetables, and more. Many diners stick to the creatively named, less than purely Italian pizza, like the Speckenwolf: freshly dried oregano, house-made mozzarella, thinly sliced speck, red onion, and roasted cremini mushrooms.

	Le Fond
",Cuisine French,"
			Chef-owner Jake Eberle's cute corner restaurant shows us that not every dish needs reimagining and not every recipe requires reinterpretation. He's a French-trained chef whose cooking is crisp, clean, and comfortingly classic-and his well-balanced menu includes words like ""roulade"" and ""blancmange"" that here seem curiously reassuring. That's not to say his food doesn't pack a punch: the rich, meaty cassoulet could keep an army on the march for days. Globe lights hang from the ceiling to illuminate a sea-blue room with bespoke wooden furniture. The acoustics can be bouncy and those lacking the necessary padding will find the seating a little numbing. But, there is honest toil and earnest endeavor happening here and it deserves support.

If you're lucky enough to snag a seat at Blanca, you'll make your way first into Roberta's lively, corrugated metal-facade, past the delicious smell of their wood-burning pizza oven and sound of vinyl records playing the blues, and through the buzzing outdoor garden. Can this many tattooed urbanites and Millennials know something you don't? Indeed. Blanca's interior is sleek and minimal, with a pristine white counter lined with cognac leather stools positioned to watch the chefs create each dish. Chef Carlo Mirarchi's nightly 20-course menu is never published beforehand, nor does the restaurant take any dietary accommodations into account. The message is loud and clear: trust us and we'll delight your senses. And delight it does as dinner might begin with deep orange lobes of sea urchin dusted with coarse sea salt and a tiny dollop of warm polenta. Then move on to impeccably fresh sliced fluke in almond water and plum vinegar, topped with fennel fronds; or tender ravioli fat with spicy 'nduja and laced with zesty grated orange.

Hearty offerings may include peasant-style lard mixed with bacon and spices, or a plate of Polish specialties piled high with pierogies (three varieties, steamed or fried, topped with sliced onions and butter), kielbasa, potato pancakes, hunter's stew, and stuffed cabbage. Grilled plates can be prepared for two or three, while others, like the roasted hocks in beer, could easily feed an army.

The ""Mexican Duo""-her most popular dish-features pulled pork- and chicken-stuffed tortillas, topped with a vibrant Chimayo chile and tangy cheese sauce, and paired with tender stewed beans sporting bright green onion; while a delicate bread pudding arrives puddled in creamy vanilla ice cream.

The bright kaleidoscope of textures and colors is a welcome sight in an otherwise downtrodden part of the borough, as is the energetic owner who drifts from table to table. Those familiar with Indian food will love Lakruwana's abundance of curries, green chili-spiked kuttu roti, as well as refreshingly salty-and-sour lassi. But their flavorful fare is considerably spicier, packing heat into everything from fiery red chili lunu miris chutney to devilled chicken. Loaded with ginger and garlic, this stellar tomato-based chicken specialty comes with cooling raita and tangy vegetable curry.

The chefs have perfected the art of wrapping hot liquid into these soft, thin pouches, complete with spiraled shoulders. To bite into a soup dumpling is so sensual that diners don't even bother to glance at the flat-screens hanging in the dining room. While the menu offers fried bean curd and smoked fish, nothing sticks like the dumplings.

			Located along quiet Northern Boulevard in Flushing, Hunan House offers a delicious reprieve from the street. The interior is crisp and sophisticated, with dark, ornately carved wood and thick linen tablecloths. But, the real draw here is the wonderfully authentic Hunanese fare, with its myriad fresh river fish; flavorful preserved meats; complex profiles; and mouth-puckering spice. Hunan House's menu is filled with exotic delights, but don't miss the wonderful starter of sautéed sour string beans featuring minced pork, chilies, ginger, and garlic; smoky dried bean curd with the same preserved meat; or spicy sliced fish-Hunan style, perfectly cooked and served in a delicious pool of fiery red sauce and plated with tender bulbs of bok choy.

It may serve as the perfect complement to smoky lamb fat, tender quail, veal heart, and seared beef sweetbread kebabs.

The contemporary dining room is spacious and airy, with the warm, always informative, staff buzzing from table to table. It's not uncommon for the manager to roll up her own sleeves when the pace elevates-and elevate it does, for this is not your average Korean barbecue. It's hard to go wrong on Hahm Ji Bach's delightful menu, but don't miss the samgyeopsal, tender slabs of well-marinated pork belly sizzled to crispy perfection tableside for you to swaddle in crisp lettuce with paper-thin daikon radish, spicy kimchi, and bright scallions; or the mit bachan, a hot clay pot with soft steamed eggs, kimchi, tofu, pickled cucumbers, and spicy mackerel.

This was the first East Coast branch of (Korean wrestler and TV personality) Kang Ho Dong's growing empire-and it is already among the best in the city. A younger sib now resides in midtown. The menu is focused, the space is enormous, the air is clean, and the service is friendly. Start your grill off with steamed egg, corn, cheese, and more to cook along the sides while marbled pork belly or deeply flavorful marinated skirt steak strips sizzle at the center. Bibimbap is a classic rendition, mixing beef seasoned with gochujang, vegetables, sesame, nori, and crisp sprouts in a hot stone bowl-so hot that it sears the bottom rice to golden while cooking the raw egg on top.

The pickled ginger salad packs a punch-crunch of fried garlic with cilantro, and makes for a cooling lead into the seafood 888 platter of Dungeness crab and crawfish-complete with a bib! For more spice, Yunnan sliced pork, straight from the face of a pig, combines fleshy meat with peanuts and chilies for a funky, must-try delight.

	Main Street Imperial Taiwanese Gourmet
",Cuisine Chinese,"
			It's a real journey to this Taiwanese treasure-not only in its trek from the closest subway stop, but more importantly, in the experience. Here, the staff speaks their mother tongue for the most part, incense wafts from an altar, and the food is otherworldly. Dishes present dazzling, authentic flavors, easily savored in the peaceful atmosphere. Sweet, head-on shrimp arrive steamed and still in the shell, housing juice that accentuates the concentrated flavor when dipped in soy sauce. Likewise, the stinky tofu (a traditional delicacy) gets its flavor from a light sauté and a finish of kimchi-style pickles. And if you're any sort of fan of the famed oyster pancake, this outstanding version will remain in your memory long after the lengthy ride home.

Beyond the whitewashed exterior and dark blue awning is a large dining room with rows of neat tables for indulging in Hellenic pleasures, from zesty appetizers to boisterous conversations. Settle into an array of pikilia; cold appetizers such as melitzansalata, eggplant whipped with herbs and olive oil. Chargrilled fish, priced by the pound, has a delightfully smoky essence and moist flesh. Whole smelts are a rare and traditional treat, simply pan-fried with a lemony herb dressing.

Booths along the edge are filled with noisy regulars. The kitchen serves the ocean's bounty, starting with a deliciously crisp and gargantuan pancake, pajeon, studded with seafood and kimchi begging to be dipped in enticingly salty soy-sesame sauce. A cloudy soup bobbing with tofu arrives piping hot, boasting that sharp, nutty, telltale flavor of fermented bean curd, and seems to have its own restorative powers.

",Cuisine Korean,"
			Murray Hill is no stranger to Korean food, but this prized, pig-loving barbecue destination is always packed. Inside, the bright room's décor forgoes all frills to focus on regional specialties. Smiling servers are earnest and hospitable. Begin with the usual but very exquisite banchan like pickled turnips, fermented bean paste soup, and specially aged house kimchi-funky, garlicky, and a total pleasure. Bowls of glassy naengmyun noodles dancing in a chilled broth with kimchi are just as popular. Yet what makes this place unique is that barbecue grill on each table, used for sizzling slices of flavorful duck with miso, garlic cloves, and bean sprouts; spicy, tender bits of octopus; and sweet, fatty pork with soy sauce, red chili paste, and scallions.

			You'll think you've died and gone to Hong Kong. Every table at this popular Flushing hot pot spot is fitted out with iPads and a square cooker, and the interior is ultra sleek. Think tufted white leather walls and flat-screen televisions dangling over the tables. It's a stylish place to cool your heels but the real star of the show exists within the kitchen's authentic hot pot selection-pork brain, anyone? You can build your own, choosing from 70+ dunkables like tender pork belly that cooks in a flash; paper-thin taro root; tender baby greens; flavorful head-on shrimp; or chewy udon noodles. From there, choose either the mild white broth or an irresistibly spicy red one bobbing with peppercorns. Better yet, get both, also known as a half and half.

Spiffy and inviting, the newcomer is already lauded for crafting scores of dumpling variations, plus comforting entrées that shouldn't be ignored. Fill your table with a dumpling feast, stuffed chock-full of duck and mushroom, spicy-sour squash, or lamb and celery redolent of lemongrass and spices. Larger dishes are equally memorable; those cold, thick, slurp-inducing green bean noodles soaked in heady, tart black vinegar with raw white sesame seeds, cilantro, cucumbers, and wood-ear mushrooms will have you coming back for more...and then some more.

	Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan
",Cuisine Chinese,"
			As New York's Sichuan renaissance continues apace, this pleasant and unpretentious Hunanese spot has popped up on Flushing's Main Street. The look here is tasteful and uncomplicated; the cooking is fiery and excellent. The extensive menu of Hunan specialties includes the likes of the classic regional dish, pork ""Mao's Style"" simmered in soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oil, and stock, then braised to tender perfection. Boasting heat and meat in equal amounts, the spicy-sour string beans with pork expertly combines rich and savory aromatics, vinegary beans, and fragrant pork with tongue-numbing peppercorns. The barbecue fish Hunan-style is a brilliant menu standout. Smaller dishes, like winter melon with seafood soup, round out an expertly prepared meal.

			Patience is a virtue at Joe's Shanghai, where a hectic rush to snag a table precedes a visit for the soup dumplings. As with most Flushing restaurants, flavor outdoes the interior decoration, with walls in need of fresh paint and dated furnishings. What the atmosphere lacks, the food fulfills as the kitchen swiftly prepares delicate xiao long bao, that despite stiff competition, still stand a head above the rest. The chefs have perfected the art of wrapping hot liquid into these soft, thin pouches, complete with spiraled shoulders. To bite into a soup dumpling is so sensual that diners don't even bother to glance at the flat-screens hanging in the dining room. While the menu offers fried bean curd and smoked fish, nothing sticks like the dumplings.

For ultimate comfort, go for the seco de cabrito, a fantastically tender lamb and aji panca stew served with chunks of cassava and extra sauce in a tiny clay kettle. The dense alfajor cookie sandwich filled with dulce de leche and crema volteada flan is a perfectly decadent ending.

And though the neighborhood has changed much since Parkside first opened its doors, the fantastic Italian-American food they dole out stands the test of time. Join in the celebratory mood and make some new friends (no one really dines alone here) while tucking into tender ribbons of savory fettuccini Alfredo; tender veal pizzaiola laced with a delectable marinara; or cannoli freshly piped with ricotta and studded with candied fruit. The irresistible desserts are wheeled around to guests on a rolling tray, of course. Old school or no school, right?

It may serve as the perfect complement to smoky lamb fat, tender quail, veal heart, and seared beef sweetbread kebabs.

These are made in-house and have a delicate, silky wrapper encasing a flavorful meatball of ground pork or crab with rich tasting broth. Eating the specialties may take some practice, but take your cue from the slurping crowd: puncture the casing on your spoon to cool the dumplings and avoid scalding your mouth.

			Arguably the best dim sum in Flushing, this spectacular gem is an absolute must for anyone seeking serious seafood and very authentic Cantonese cooking. A longtime resident of 39th Avenue, the expansive dining room is outfitted with round, banquet-style tables, bamboo plants, and ornate chandeliers.

			You may second-guess your arrival to Crazy Crab 888 when you see the tarred-over landscape and auto body shops, but one step inside this downright delicious gem dispels any and all reservations. A sort of Burmese-Chinese seafood shack with influences from India and Thailand, the food offers recognizable ingredients in creative combos worthy of its wacky title-in Chinese culture, the number 8 is known to bring much good luck. The pickled ginger salad packs a punch-crunch of fried garlic with cilantro, and makes for a cooling lead into the seafood 888 platter of Dungeness crab and crawfish-complete with a bib! For more spice, Yunnan sliced pork, straight from the face of a pig, combines fleshy meat with peanuts and chilies for a funky, must-try delight.

Here, the staff speaks their mother tongue for the most part, incense wafts from an altar, and the food is otherworldly. Dishes present dazzling, authentic flavors, easily savored in the peaceful atmosphere. Sweet, head-on shrimp arrive steamed and still in the shell, housing juice that accentuates the concentrated flavor when dipped in soy sauce. Likewise, the stinky tofu (a traditional delicacy) gets its flavor from a light sauté and a finish of kimchi-style pickles. And if you're any sort of fan of the famed oyster pancake, this outstanding version will remain in your memory long after the lengthy ride home.

This is the place to hit for deep bowlfuls of restorative Chinese noodle soups that could carry you through the day-picture translucent bean threads, long slices of dried tofu, and morsels of lamb bobbing among fragrant cilantro, Chinese wolfberries, and black tree mushrooms in a broth enhanced with smoky chili paste. Other intriguing dishes unveil delicate kingfish steaks that have been subtly smoked, gently spiced, and served chilled. The black bone chicken and ginseng soup showcases the dark flesh and deep flavor of its ingredients.

",Cuisine Chinese,"
			You might mistake Imperial Palace for one of those red awning-covered restaurants on this strip of Chinese eateries-but don't. While it may share the same lettered signage, wide windows, and nondescript facade, inside find some of the best sticky rice and Dungeness crab Flushing has to offer. Seafood is front and center, with servers promptly presenting everything from deep-fried jumbo shrimp tossed with candied sesame walnuts to shrimp-stuffed tofu with slices of conch. It's easy to plow through all the fresh shellfish dishes with a chilled beer and sweet rice, but try to leave room for the clam casserole: a spicy broth full of Cantonese flavors, loads of onions, and small, briny clams, finished with a sprinkling of crisp coriander stems.

The menu is focused, the space is enormous, the air is clean, and the service is friendly. Start your grill off with steamed egg, corn, cheese, and more to cook along the sides while marbled pork belly or deeply flavorful marinated skirt steak strips sizzle at the center. Bibimbap is a classic rendition, mixing beef seasoned with gochujang, vegetables, sesame, nori, and crisp sprouts in a hot stone bowl-so hot that it sears the bottom rice to golden while cooking the raw egg on top.

	Biáng!

			Biáng! isn't exotic by accident. In fact, Chef/owner Jason Wang's cuisine interplays contrasts and textures with the intention to excite. Tucked into Flushing's main artery, the setting is boisterous and tables are busy, but shabby-chic details like a plate-glass exterior are the first sign that you're in for an unencumbered and unique treat. Dark walls and floors cover the inside, but gentle lighting and lofty ceilings add dimension to the narrow space. Strong flavors and fiery oils star in dishes like crispy lotus root tossed in an earthy sesame vinaigrette; fresh buckwheat noodles mingled with cucumber, soy, and mustard oil; and chang, hot, creamy tofu with pickled vegetables. Lamb burgers seasoned with jalapeños and cumin are a fitting signature.

To bite into a soup dumpling is so sensual that diners don't even bother to glance at the flat-screens hanging in the dining room.

Settle into an array of pikilia; cold appetizers such as melitzansalata, eggplant whipped with herbs and olive oil. Chargrilled fish, priced by the pound, has a delightfully smoky essence and moist flesh. Whole smelts are a rare and traditional treat, simply pan-fried with a lemony herb dressing. Finish with a choice of authentic, nutty, and syrup-soaked pastries.

The restaurant's impeccably cool style extends from its angled exterior ablaze in beams of yellow light to its sleek interior with exposed brick walls and bare wood tables. The attractive art gallery next door is attached and doubles as a private dining space. Meals begin with an unending supply of wonderfully crisp and mild house kimchi. Also try the hearty bibimbap of marinated beef strips, root vegetables, and mushrooms alongside a bowl of ox-bone broth. The main attraction is the sensational jeon, traditional Korean pancakes grilled to order (weekend dinners, only). Round out the meal with steamed pigs feet accompanied by Tang's special fiery, salty, shrimp-based dipping sauce.

It's a stylish place to cool your heels but the real star of the show exists within the kitchen's authentic hot pot selection-pork brain, anyone? You can build your own, choosing from 70+ dunkables like tender pork belly that cooks in a flash; paper-thin taro root; tender baby greens; flavorful head-on shrimp; or chewy udon noodles. From there, choose either the mild white broth or an irresistibly spicy red one bobbing with peppercorns. Better yet, get both, also known as a half and half.

			This upscale Japanese restaurant tucked into the newly constructed Hyatt Place Hotel is a lovely addition to the Queens dining scene. Duck inside the modern glass façade and you're greeted with curving leather booths; thick wood tables; and beautiful blonde flooring. You've seen this before, you think to yourself, but only in Brooklyn or Manhattan. This is Queens in high heels. Diners can opt for traditional omakase or à la carte: the former might begin with silky house-made tofu, topped with caviar and cool dashi. Then move on to a fresh Dungeness crab salad with yuzu jelly and crab roe; soft shell crab and zucchini flower tempura; soft Wagyu carpaccio dusted with sea salt and truffles; or a bright, rainbow-assortment of fresh sushi.

As with most Flushing restaurants, flavor outdoes the interior decoration, with walls in need of fresh paint and dated furnishings. What the atmosphere lacks, the food fulfills as the kitchen swiftly prepares delicate xiao long bao, that despite stiff competition, still stand a head above the rest. The chefs have perfected the art of wrapping hot liquid into these soft, thin pouches, complete with spiraled shoulders. To bite into a soup dumpling is so sensual that diners don't even bother to glance at the flat-screens hanging in the dining room. While the menu offers fried bean curd and smoked fish, nothing sticks like the dumplings.

			Located along quiet Northern Boulevard in Flushing, Hunan House offers a delicious reprieve from the street. The interior is crisp and sophisticated, with dark, ornately carved wood and thick linen tablecloths. But, the real draw here is the wonderfully authentic Hunanese fare, with its myriad fresh river fish; flavorful preserved meats; complex profiles; and mouth-puckering spice. Hunan House's menu is filled with exotic delights, but don't miss the wonderful starter of sautéed sour string beans featuring minced pork, chilies, ginger, and garlic; smoky dried bean curd with the same preserved meat; or spicy sliced fish-Hunan style, perfectly cooked and served in a delicious pool of fiery red sauce and plated with tender bulbs of bok choy.

Bring your own vodka and start with the house specialty, chebureki, an empanada-like deep-fried wrap stuffed with either hand-cut lamb seasoned with cumin, chili, cilantro, and paprika; or fennel-sparked cabbage. It may serve as the perfect complement to smoky lamb fat, tender quail, veal heart, and seared beef sweetbread kebabs.

The contemporary dining room is spacious and airy, with the warm, always informative, staff buzzing from table to table. It's not uncommon for the manager to roll up her own sleeves when the pace elevates-and elevate it does, for this is not your average Korean barbecue. It's hard to go wrong on Hahm Ji Bach's delightful menu, but don't miss the samgyeopsal, tender slabs of well-marinated pork belly sizzled to crispy perfection tableside for you to swaddle in crisp lettuce with paper-thin daikon radish, spicy kimchi, and bright scallions; or the mit bachan, a hot clay pot with soft steamed eggs, kimchi, tofu, pickled cucumbers, and spicy mackerel.

			The Korean barbecue of the moment is a short LIRR trip away, and well worth the ride. This was the first East Coast branch of (Korean wrestler and TV personality) Kang Ho Dong's growing empire-and it is already among the best in the city. A younger sib now resides in midtown. The menu is focused, the space is enormous, the air is clean, and the service is friendly. Start your grill off with steamed egg, corn, cheese, and more to cook along the sides while marbled pork belly or deeply flavorful marinated skirt steak strips sizzle at the center. Bibimbap is a classic rendition, mixing beef seasoned with gochujang, vegetables, sesame, nori, and crisp sprouts in a hot stone bowl-so hot that it sears the bottom rice to golden while cooking the raw egg on top.

Strong flavors and fiery oils star in dishes like crispy lotus root tossed in an earthy sesame vinaigrette; fresh buckwheat noodles mingled with cucumber, soy, and mustard oil; and chang, hot, creamy tofu with pickled vegetables.

The pickled ginger salad packs a punch-crunch of fried garlic with cilantro, and makes for a cooling lead into the seafood 888 platter of Dungeness crab and crawfish-complete with a bib! For more spice, Yunnan sliced pork, straight from the face of a pig, combines fleshy meat with peanuts and chilies for a funky, must-try delight.

	Main Street Imperial Taiwanese Gourmet
",Cuisine Chinese,"
			It's a real journey to this Taiwanese treasure-not only in its trek from the closest subway stop, but more importantly, in the experience. Here, the staff speaks their mother tongue for the most part, incense wafts from an altar, and the food is otherworldly. Dishes present dazzling, authentic flavors, easily savored in the peaceful atmosphere. Sweet, head-on shrimp arrive steamed and still in the shell, housing juice that accentuates the concentrated flavor when dipped in soy sauce. Likewise, the stinky tofu (a traditional delicacy) gets its flavor from a light sauté and a finish of kimchi-style pickles. And if you're any sort of fan of the famed oyster pancake, this outstanding version will remain in your memory long after the lengthy ride home.

Beyond the whitewashed exterior and dark blue awning is a large dining room with rows of neat tables for indulging in Hellenic pleasures, from zesty appetizers to boisterous conversations. Settle into an array of pikilia; cold appetizers such as melitzansalata, eggplant whipped with herbs and olive oil. Chargrilled fish, priced by the pound, has a delightfully smoky essence and moist flesh. Whole smelts are a rare and traditional treat, simply pan-fried with a lemony herb dressing.

Booths along the edge are filled with noisy regulars. The kitchen serves the ocean's bounty, starting with a deliciously crisp and gargantuan pancake, pajeon, studded with seafood and kimchi begging to be dipped in enticingly salty soy-sesame sauce. A cloudy soup bobbing with tofu arrives piping hot, boasting that sharp, nutty, telltale flavor of fermented bean curd, and seems to have its own restorative powers.

",Cuisine Korean,"
			Murray Hill is no stranger to Korean food, but this prized, pig-loving barbecue destination is always packed. Inside, the bright room's décor forgoes all frills to focus on regional specialties. Smiling servers are earnest and hospitable. Begin with the usual but very exquisite banchan like pickled turnips, fermented bean paste soup, and specially aged house kimchi-funky, garlicky, and a total pleasure. Bowls of glassy naengmyun noodles dancing in a chilled broth with kimchi are just as popular. Yet what makes this place unique is that barbecue grill on each table, used for sizzling slices of flavorful duck with miso, garlic cloves, and bean sprouts; spicy, tender bits of octopus; and sweet, fatty pork with soy sauce, red chili paste, and scallions.

			You'll think you've died and gone to Hong Kong. Every table at this popular Flushing hot pot spot is fitted out with iPads and a square cooker, and the interior is ultra sleek. Think tufted white leather walls and flat-screen televisions dangling over the tables. It's a stylish place to cool your heels but the real star of the show exists within the kitchen's authentic hot pot selection-pork brain, anyone? You can build your own, choosing from 70+ dunkables like tender pork belly that cooks in a flash; paper-thin taro root; tender baby greens; flavorful head-on shrimp; or chewy udon noodles. From there, choose either the mild white broth or an irresistibly spicy red one bobbing with peppercorns. Better yet, get both, also known as a half and half.

Spiffy and inviting, the newcomer is already lauded for crafting scores of dumpling variations, plus comforting entrées that shouldn't be ignored. Fill your table with a dumpling feast, stuffed chock-full of duck and mushroom, spicy-sour squash, or lamb and celery redolent of lemongrass and spices. Larger dishes are equally memorable; those cold, thick, slurp-inducing green bean noodles soaked in heady, tart black vinegar with raw white sesame seeds, cilantro, cucumbers, and wood-ear mushrooms will have you coming back for more...and then some more.

	Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan
",Cuisine Chinese,"
			As New York's Sichuan renaissance continues apace, this pleasant and unpretentious Hunanese spot has popped up on Flushing's Main Street. The look here is tasteful and uncomplicated; the cooking is fiery and excellent. The extensive menu of Hunan specialties includes the likes of the classic regional dish, pork ""Mao's Style"" simmered in soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oil, and stock, then braised to tender perfection. Boasting heat and meat in equal amounts, the spicy-sour string beans with pork expertly combines rich and savory aromatics, vinegary beans, and fragrant pork with tongue-numbing peppercorns. The barbecue fish Hunan-style is a brilliant menu standout. Smaller dishes, like winter melon with seafood soup, round out an expertly prepared meal.

			Patience is a virtue at Joe's Shanghai, where a hectic rush to snag a table precedes a visit for the soup dumplings. As with most Flushing restaurants, flavor outdoes the interior decoration, with walls in need of fresh paint and dated furnishings. What the atmosphere lacks, the food fulfills as the kitchen swiftly prepares delicate xiao long bao, that despite stiff competition, still stand a head above the rest. The chefs have perfected the art of wrapping hot liquid into these soft, thin pouches, complete with spiraled shoulders. To bite into a soup dumpling is so sensual that diners don't even bother to glance at the flat-screens hanging in the dining room. While the menu offers fried bean curd and smoked fish, nothing sticks like the dumplings.

For ultimate comfort, go for the seco de cabrito, a fantastically tender lamb and aji panca stew served with chunks of cassava and extra sauce in a tiny clay kettle. The dense alfajor cookie sandwich filled with dulce de leche and crema volteada flan is a perfectly decadent ending.

And though the neighborhood has changed much since Parkside first opened its doors, the fantastic Italian-American food they dole out stands the test of time. Join in the celebratory mood and make some new friends (no one really dines alone here) while tucking into tender ribbons of savory fettuccini Alfredo; tender veal pizzaiola laced with a delectable marinara; or cannoli freshly piped with ricotta and studded with candied fruit. The irresistible desserts are wheeled around to guests on a rolling tray, of course. Old school or no school, right?

It may serve as the perfect complement to smoky lamb fat, tender quail, veal heart, and seared beef sweetbread kebabs.

These are made in-house and have a delicate, silky wrapper encasing a flavorful meatball of ground pork or crab with rich tasting broth. Eating the specialties may take some practice, but take your cue from the slurping crowd: puncture the casing on your spoon to cool the dumplings and avoid scalding your mouth.

			Arguably the best dim sum in Flushing, this spectacular gem is an absolute must for anyone seeking serious seafood and very authentic Cantonese cooking. A longtime resident of 39th Avenue, the expansive dining room is outfitted with round, banquet-style tables, bamboo plants, and ornate chandeliers.

			You may second-guess your arrival to Crazy Crab 888 when you see the tarred-over landscape and auto body shops, but one step inside this downright delicious gem dispels any and all reservations. A sort of Burmese-Chinese seafood shack with influences from India and Thailand, the food offers recognizable ingredients in creative combos worthy of its wacky title-in Chinese culture, the number 8 is known to bring much good luck. The pickled ginger salad packs a punch-crunch of fried garlic with cilantro, and makes for a cooling lead into the seafood 888 platter of Dungeness crab and crawfish-complete with a bib! For more spice, Yunnan sliced pork, straight from the face of a pig, combines fleshy meat with peanuts and chilies for a funky, must-try delight.

Here, the staff speaks their mother tongue for the most part, incense wafts from an altar, and the food is otherworldly. Dishes present dazzling, authentic flavors, easily savored in the peaceful atmosphere. Sweet, head-on shrimp arrive steamed and still in the shell, housing juice that accentuates the concentrated flavor when dipped in soy sauce. Likewise, the stinky tofu (a traditional delicacy) gets its flavor from a light sauté and a finish of kimchi-style pickles. And if you're any sort of fan of the famed oyster pancake, this outstanding version will remain in your memory long after the lengthy ride home.

This is the place to hit for deep bowlfuls of restorative Chinese noodle soups that could carry you through the day-picture translucent bean threads, long slices of dried tofu, and morsels of lamb bobbing among fragrant cilantro, Chinese wolfberries, and black tree mushrooms in a broth enhanced with smoky chili paste. Other intriguing dishes unveil delicate kingfish steaks that have been subtly smoked, gently spiced, and served chilled. The black bone chicken and ginseng soup showcases the dark flesh and deep flavor of its ingredients.

",Cuisine Chinese,"
			You might mistake Imperial Palace for one of those red awning-covered restaurants on this strip of Chinese eateries-but don't. While it may share the same lettered signage, wide windows, and nondescript facade, inside find some of the best sticky rice and Dungeness crab Flushing has to offer. Seafood is front and center, with servers promptly presenting everything from deep-fried jumbo shrimp tossed with candied sesame walnuts to shrimp-stuffed tofu with slices of conch. It's easy to plow through all the fresh shellfish dishes with a chilled beer and sweet rice, but try to leave room for the clam casserole: a spicy broth full of Cantonese flavors, loads of onions, and small, briny clams, finished with a sprinkling of crisp coriander stems.

The menu is focused, the space is enormous, the air is clean, and the service is friendly. Start your grill off with steamed egg, corn, cheese, and more to cook along the sides while marbled pork belly or deeply flavorful marinated skirt steak strips sizzle at the center. Bibimbap is a classic rendition, mixing beef seasoned with gochujang, vegetables, sesame, nori, and crisp sprouts in a hot stone bowl-so hot that it sears the bottom rice to golden while cooking the raw egg on top.

	Biáng!
",Cuisine Chinese,"
			Biáng! isn't exotic by accident. In fact, Chef/owner Jason Wang's cuisine interplays contrasts and textures with the intention to excite. Tucked into Flushing's main artery, the setting is boisterous and tables are busy, but shabby-chic details like a plate-glass exterior are the first sign that you're in for an unencumbered and unique treat. Dark walls and floors cover the inside, but gentle lighting and lofty ceilings add dimension to the narrow space. Strong flavors and fiery oils star in dishes like crispy lotus root tossed in an earthy sesame vinaigrette; fresh buckwheat noodles mingled with cucumber, soy, and mustard oil; and chang, hot, creamy tofu with pickled vegetables. Lamb burgers seasoned with jalapeños and cumin are a fitting signature.

	Dumpling Galaxy
",Cuisine Chinese,"
			Neon bounces off all the new, shiny surfaces at Dumpling Galaxy, inside the Arcadia Mall. Navigate beyond the phone retailers and stalls to find this huge, modern space full of red booths and hanging red lights. Spiffy and inviting, the newcomer is already lauded for crafting scores of dumpling variations, plus comforting entrées that shouldn't be ignored. Fill your table with a dumpling feast, stuffed chock-full of duck and mushroom, spicy-sour squash, or lamb and celery redolent of lemongrass and spices. Larger dishes are equally memorable; those cold, thick, slurp-inducing green bean noodles soaked in heady, tart black vinegar with raw white sesame seeds, cilantro, cucumbers, and wood-ear mushrooms will have you coming back for more...and then some more.

	Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan
",Cuisine Chinese,"
			As New York's Sichuan renaissance continues apace, this pleasant and unpretentious Hunanese spot has popped up on Flushing's Main Street. The look here is tasteful and uncomplicated; the cooking is fiery and excellent. The extensive menu of Hunan specialties includes the likes of the classic regional dish, pork ""Mao's Style"" simmered in soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oil, and stock, then braised to tender perfection. Boasting heat and meat in equal amounts, the spicy-sour string beans with pork expertly combines rich and savory aromatics, vinegary beans, and fragrant pork with tongue-numbing peppercorns. The barbecue fish Hunan-style is a brilliant menu standout. Smaller dishes, like winter melon with seafood soup, round out an expertly prepared meal.

	Joe's Shanghai
",Cuisine Chinese,"
			Patience is a virtue at Joe's Shanghai, where a hectic rush to snag a table precedes a visit for the soup dumplings. As with most Flushing restaurants, flavor outdoes the interior decoration, with walls in need of fresh paint and dated furnishings. What the atmosphere lacks, the food fulfills as the kitchen swiftly prepares delicate xiao long bao, that despite stiff competition, still stand a head above the rest. The chefs have perfected the art of wrapping hot liquid into these soft, thin pouches, complete with spiraled shoulders. To bite into a soup dumpling is so sensual that diners don't even bother to glance at the flat-screens hanging in the dining room. While the menu offers fried bean curd and smoked fish, nothing sticks like the dumplings.

			Located along quiet Northern Boulevard in Flushing, Hunan House offers a delicious reprieve from the street. The interior is crisp and sophisticated, with dark, ornately carved wood and thick linen tablecloths. But, the real draw here is the wonderfully authentic Hunanese fare, with its myriad fresh river fish; flavorful preserved meats; complex profiles; and mouth-puckering spice. Hunan House's menu is filled with exotic delights, but don't miss the wonderful starter of sautéed sour string beans featuring minced pork, chilies, ginger, and garlic; smoky dried bean curd with the same preserved meat; or spicy sliced fish-Hunan style, perfectly cooked and served in a delicious pool of fiery red sauce and plated with tender bulbs of bok choy.

The crowds have calmed, so tables are often available at peak meal times. This is the place to hit for deep bowlfuls of restorative Chinese noodle soups that could carry you through the day-picture translucent bean threads, long slices of dried tofu, and morsels of lamb bobbing among fragrant cilantro, Chinese wolfberries, and black tree mushrooms in a broth enhanced with smoky chili paste. Other intriguing dishes unveil delicate kingfish steaks that have been subtly smoked, gently spiced, and served chilled. The black bone chicken and ginseng soup showcases the dark flesh and deep flavor of its ingredients.

			You might mistake Imperial Palace for one of those red awning-covered restaurants on this strip of Chinese eateries-but don't. While it may share the same lettered signage, wide windows, and nondescript facade, inside find some of the best sticky rice and Dungeness crab Flushing has to offer. Seafood is front and center, with servers promptly presenting everything from deep-fried jumbo shrimp tossed with candied sesame walnuts to shrimp-stuffed tofu with slices of conch. It's easy to plow through all the fresh shellfish dishes with a chilled beer and sweet rice, but try to leave room for the clam casserole: a spicy broth full of Cantonese flavors, loads of onions, and small, briny clams, finished with a sprinkling of crisp coriander stems.

Dressed in silly costumes, the staff is always having a blast in this seasonally decorated shack-like dining room featuring corrugated metal roofs, street lights, buckets for shells, and walls papered in dollar bills. Booths along the edge are filled with noisy regulars. The kitchen serves the ocean's bounty, starting with a deliciously crisp and gargantuan pancake, pajeon, studded with seafood and kimchi begging to be dipped in enticingly salty soy-sesame sauce. A cloudy soup bobbing with tofu arrives piping hot, boasting that sharp, nutty, telltale flavor of fermented bean curd, and seems to have its own restorative powers.

			Murray Hill is no stranger to Korean food, but this prized, pig-loving barbecue destination is always packed. Inside, the bright room's décor forgoes all frills to focus on regional specialties. Smiling servers are earnest and hospitable. Begin with the usual but very exquisite banchan like pickled turnips, fermented bean paste soup, and specially aged house kimchi-funky, garlicky, and a total pleasure. Bowls of glassy naengmyun noodles dancing in a chilled broth with kimchi are just as popular. Yet what makes this place unique is that barbecue grill on each table, used for sizzling slices of flavorful duck with miso, garlic cloves, and bean sprouts; spicy, tender bits of octopus; and sweet, fatty pork with soy sauce, red chili paste, and scallions.

			You'll think you've died and gone to Hong Kong. Every table at this popular Flushing hot pot spot is fitted out with iPads and a square cooker, and the interior is ultra sleek. Think tufted white leather walls and flat-screen televisions dangling over the tables. It's a stylish place to cool your heels but the real star of the show exists within the kitchen's authentic hot pot selection-pork brain, anyone? You can build your own, choosing from 70+ dunkables like tender pork belly that cooks in a flash; paper-thin taro root; tender baby greens; flavorful head-on shrimp; or chewy udon noodles. From there, choose either the mild white broth or an irresistibly spicy red one bobbing with peppercorns. Better yet, get both, also known as a half and half.

You've seen this before, you think to yourself, but only in Brooklyn or Manhattan. This is Queens in high heels. Diners can opt for traditional omakase or à la carte: the former might begin with silky house-made tofu, topped with caviar and cool dashi. Then move on to a fresh Dungeness crab salad with yuzu jelly and crab roe; soft shell crab and zucchini flower tempura; soft Wagyu carpaccio dusted with sea salt and truffles; or a bright, rainbow-assortment of fresh sushi.

Simply decorated, the comfortable dining room features rows of closely set tables and a mirrored wall that successfully gives the illusion of space.

These are made in-house and have a delicate, silky wrapper encasing a flavorful meatball of ground pork or crab with rich tasting broth.

A sort of Burmese-Chinese seafood shack with influences from India and Thailand, the food offers recognizable ingredients in creative combos worthy of its wacky title-in Chinese culture, the number 8 is known to bring much good luck. The pickled ginger salad packs a punch-crunch of fried garlic with cilantro, and makes for a cooling lead into the seafood 888 platter of Dungeness crab and crawfish-complete with a bib! For more spice, Yunnan sliced pork, straight from the face of a pig, combines fleshy meat with peanuts and chilies for a funky, must-try delight.

Here, the staff speaks their mother tongue for the most part, incense wafts from an altar, and the food is otherworldly. Dishes present dazzling, authentic flavors, easily savored in the peaceful atmosphere. Sweet, head-on shrimp arrive steamed and still in the shell, housing juice that accentuates the concentrated flavor when dipped in soy sauce. Likewise, the stinky tofu (a traditional delicacy) gets its flavor from a light sauté and a finish of kimchi-style pickles. And if you're any sort of fan of the famed oyster pancake, this outstanding version will remain in your memory long after the lengthy ride home.

For ultimate comfort, go for the seco de cabrito, a fantastically tender lamb and aji panca stew served with chunks of cassava and extra sauce in a tiny clay kettle. The dense alfajor cookie sandwich filled with dulce de leche and crema volteada flan is a perfectly decadent ending.

Join in the celebratory mood and make some new friends (no one really dines alone here) while tucking into tender ribbons of savory fettuccini Alfredo; tender veal pizzaiola laced with a delectable marinara; or cannoli freshly piped with ricotta and studded with candied fruit. The irresistible desserts are wheeled around to guests on a rolling tray, of course. Old school or no school, right?

The focused menu is more engrossing than the décor, and it's easy to want every cumin- and paprika-laced item on it.

It may serve as the perfect complement to smoky lamb fat, tender quail, veal heart, and seared beef sweetbread kebabs.
