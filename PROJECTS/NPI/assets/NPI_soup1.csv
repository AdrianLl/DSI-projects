<meta content=""In the years since Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954), there have 
been many well-intentioned but unsuccessful efforts to close America’s 
racial and ethnic gaps in academic achievement. At the time of Brown, 75 
percent to 85 percent of the nation’s Black students (and 75 percent of 
Latinos) scored below the median for Whites on standardized academic tests. 
That has been the case ever since. Despite extensive government 
intervention and numerous educational reforms, the disparities remain. This 
persistent “achievement gap” has become one of the most comprehensively 
documented facts in American educational history.

“Closing the gap”—that is, ending racial disparities through new 
educational methods or public policies—has been a recurring political 
leitmotif for the past half-century. It has been a ubiquitous and deeply 
contentious meme, which has played a role in virtually every national 
election.

And yet so many reformers take up “closing the gap” as if for the first 
time. They ignore the complex history of education reformers, which I have 
recounted in my most recent book, The Long Crusade (2015), and the 
important lessons that can be gleaned from what can only be considered a 
history of failures.

Education is undoubtedly critical for sustaining and advancing any advanced 
society. It is time for those who care about education to ask the difficult 
questions that past reformers overlooked. The most important of which is 
whether racial achievement gaps can be closed at all."" property=""og:description""/>

<p>In the years since <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em> (1954), there have been many well-intentioned but unsuccessful efforts to close America’s racial and ethnic gaps in academic achievement. At the time of <em>Brown,</em> 75 percent to 85 percent of the nation’s Black students (and 75 percent of Latinos) scored below the median for Whites on standardized academic tests. That has been the case ever since. Despite extensive government intervention and numerous educational reforms, the disparities remain. This persistent “achievement gap” has become one of the most comprehensively documented facts in American educational history.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:1"" id=""fnref:1"" title=""see footnote"">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>“Closing the gap”—that is, ending racial disparities through new educational methods or public policies—has been a recurring political <em>leitmotif</em> for the past half-century. It has been a ubiquitous and deeply contentious meme, which has played a role in virtually every national election.</p>
<p>And yet so many reformers take up “closing the gap” as if for the first time. They ignore the complex history of education reformers, which I have recounted in my most recent book, <em>The Long Crusade</em> (2015), and the important lessons that can be gleaned from what can only be considered a history of failures.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:2"" id=""fnref:2"" title=""see footnote"">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Education is undoubtedly critical for sustaining and advancing any advanced society. It is time for those who care about education to ask the difficult questions that past reformers overlooked. The most important of which is whether racial achievement gaps can be closed at all.</p>
<center><h2>1.</h2></center>
<p>School desegregation was the first in a series of interventions and reforms that failed to close the gaps. Despite initial resistance in the South, by the end of the 1960s, the great majority of Americans accepted the desegregation that <em>Brown</em> had mandated. In large part this acceptance occurred because both the Supreme Court and the U. S. Congress made it clear that desegregation required only that public schools should not discriminate racially. In several decisions between 1954 and 1968, the Supreme Court handed down rulings (and upheld lower-court decisions) that forbade the exclusion of children from public schools solely on the grounds of race. But the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts did not insist that compulsory <em>inclusion</em> must begin. They held, rather, that the proper remedy for compulsory separation was to end such separation.</p>
<p>The courts did not demand that enrollments at individual schools should be balanced to achieve approximately the same proportions that existed in a larger region or state. Congress endorsed this approach in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which defined “desegregation” both positively and negatively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Desegregation” means the assignment of students to public schools and within such schools without regard to their race, color, religion, or national origin, but “desegregation” shall not mean the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial imbalance.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:3"" id=""fnref:3"" title=""see footnote"">[3]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In so ruling, the Supreme Court and Congress accepted an argument that Thurgood Marshall and other attorneys presented for the NAACP. When questioned during the oral arguments for <em>Brown</em>, these lawyers were emphatic that they were “not asking for affirmative relief.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only thing that we ask for is that the state-imposed racial segregation be taken off, and to leave the county school board … to assign children on any reasonable basis they want to assign them on… .</p>
<p>What we want from this Court is the striking down of race… .</p>
<p>Do not deny any child the right to go to the school of his choice on the grounds of race or color within the normal limits of your districting system… .</p>
<p>Do not assign them on the basis of race… .</p>
<p>If you have some other basis … any other basis, we have no objection. But just do not put in race or color as a factor.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:4"" id=""fnref:4"" title=""see footnote"">[4]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Civil-rights leaders said official separation of Black students grew out of a belief that Negroes as a race were incapable of matching the educational and civilizational standards of Whites. But Thurgood Marshall argued that many individual Blacks had met those standards; therefore, general racial segregation was too “arbitrary and invidious” to satisfy the requirement that states must provide “equal protection of the laws … in any public sphere. ”Marshall said segregation branded “the Negro with the mark of inferiority and asserts that he is not fit to associate with white people.” Marshall wrote, “Distinctions by race are so evil, so arbitrary and invidious that a state bound to defend the equal protection of the laws must not invoke them in any public sphere.” Marshall conceded, however, that states could discriminate on the basis of individual qualities. When asked what should be done with individual students, Marshall answered: “Put the dumb colored children in with the dumb white children, and put the smart colored children with the smart white children.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:5"" id=""fnref:5"" title=""see footnote"">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Since Marshall and the NAACP won the case, most people assumed that the <em>Brown</em> Court had held that the Constitution prohibited the government from discriminating by race. This impression was reinforced when the Supreme Court, in <em>Bolling</em> <em>v. Sharpe</em> (decided the same day as <em>Brown</em>), held that racial classifications were too arbitrary to satisfy the requirements of the due-process clause. The impression was confirmed in 1955 when the implementation order known as <em>Brown II</em> declared that <em>Brown</em> stood for “the fundamental principle” that there should be no “racial discrimination in public education.” And the impression was reaffirmed in numerous other cases where the Supreme Court upheld lower-court rulings, such as one in South Carolina, where circuit judge John J. Parker interpreted <em>Brown</em> to mean that, “The Constitution … does not require integration. It merely forbids discrimination.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:6"" id=""fnref:6"" title=""see footnote"">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many later problems would have been avoided if the <em>Brown</em> Court had merely forbad racial discrimination. Legal scholars, however, have noted that the Supreme Court’s legal rationale in <em>Brown</em> was murky and inconsistent. On one hand, <em>Brown</em> condemned racial discrimination by the government. On the other, the Court looked with disfavor on the congregation of Blacks, even if this association was not compelled by government authorities. The <em>Brown</em> Court approvingly cited the social science of Swedish scholar Gunnar Myrdal, who maintained that Black society was so emotional, provincial, and crime-ridden as to be essentially pathological. The Court also endorsed a weak study and misleading testimony by an American psychologist, Kenneth Clark, who told the Justices that racial isolation damaged the confidence of Black youths and depressed their ambitions and self-esteem. The <em>Brown</em> Court said the separation of Black students generated “a feeling of inferiority as to theirs status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.” <em>Brown</em> approvingly repeated the conclusion of a Kansas court: that Black schools tended “to [retard] the educational and mental development of Negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they could receive” in racially integrated schools. <em>Brown</em> embraced what is sometimes called “the harm and benefit thesis.” It held that racial congregation harmed Blacks and implied that racial mixing would help African-Americans do better academically.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:7"" id=""fnref:7"" title=""see footnote"">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Pursuant to the original understanding of <em>Brown,</em> by the late 1960s, the great majority of American public school students were being assigned on a racially non-discriminatory basis. This was usually accomplished in one of two ways. Either students were assigned to schools close to their homes or they were allowed to attend whatever school they chose. By assigning students by neighborhood rather than race or by allowing students to choose their school, school districts satisfied the requirements of <em>Brown</em> and the Civil Rights Act. Students were no longer being assigned on a racial basis. Yet neither policy achieved a racial mix in school enrollments that approximated the demographic proportions in the larger region. Enrollments in neighborhood schools turned out to be either mostly White or mostly Black because most Whites and Blacks lived in neighborhoods that were inhabited predominantly by people of their own race. Enrollments in choice schools were also skewed because most students did not wish to attend a school in which their race would be a minority.</p>
<p>Thus Blacks were liberated from the stigma of official separation. But, as it turned out, mere desegregation did not narrow the racial gap in academic achievement. On most standardized tests, almost 85 percent of the Black students continued to score below the average White.</p>
<center><h2>2.</h2></center>
<p>Why did the academic achievement gap persist? In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the most common explanation held that disproportionately Black schools were inadequately funded. With this in mind, the 1964 Civil Rights Act provided one million dollars for a survey of educational inequalities. According to Alexander Mood, the director of the statistical center at the federal Office of Education, it was assumed “that the schools in the cores of cities and in the rural South are inferior in terms of class size, teacher training, enrichment and remedial programs, and per pupil expenditures.” The research turned out to be so comprehensive and of such high quality that it superseded all previous work on school desegregation. Entitled <em>Equality of Educational Opportunity</em> (1966) and popularly known as “the Coleman report” for its principal author, James S. Coleman, then a professor of educational sociology at Johns Hopkins University, the study presented detailed information on 4,000 schools and test results from 570,000 students and 60,000 teachers. The report was of especially high quality because Coleman was the foremost mathematical sociologist of his age. His sophisticated statistical analysis of the quantitative information was evident on page after page.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:8"" id=""fnref:8"" title=""see footnote"">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Coleman report reinforced two aspects of conventional thinking. It showed that the familiar disparity in test scores was still in place. And it showed that, as of 1966, the races were still disproportionately educated apart from one another. Eighty percent of all White pupils in the first and twelfth grades attended schools that were between 90 to 100 percent White; while 65 percent of all African-American first graders attended schools that were at least 90 percent Black, and 48 percent of Black high school seniors attended schools that were at least half Black.</p>
<p>In another respect, however, the data contradicted the conventional wisdom. At the outset of the research, Coleman had predicted, “the study will show the difference in the quality of schools that the average Negro child and the average white child are exposed to.” Speaking to a reporter, Coleman had said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know yourself that the difference is going to be striking. And even though everybody knows there is a lot of difference between suburban and inner-city schools, once the statistics are there in black and white, they will have more impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet to Coleman’s surprise, when the data were assembled, they indicated that by 1966 there was substantial equality in facilities and other measureable resources at majority-Black and majority-White schools. Predominantly Black and White schools had the same average number of teachers per pupil, similar pay scales, and teachers with almost the same amount of formal education and teaching experience. Put simply, by 1966, the nation had achieved the traditional notion of equality of educational opportunity.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:9"" id=""fnref:9"" title=""see footnote"">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>And yet, on standardized tests the academic achievement gaps had hardly budged. The average African-American student still scored below 85 percent of White students. Put differently, at age six, the average Black lagged behind the average White by one grade level, and by grade 12, the gap separating the racial averages had increased to four grade levels. Coleman understood that the report was “tread[ing] on sensitive ground.” The differences could “lead to invidious comparisons between groups” and, even worse, might “lend [support] to racist arguments of genetic differences in intelligence.” Nevertheless, Coleman decided that it would be a mistake not to mention the gap in academic achievement. “It is precisely the avoidance of such sensitive areas that can perpetuate the educational deficiencies.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:10"" id=""fnref:10"" title=""see footnote"">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<center><h2>3.</h2></center>
<p>To make his report more palatable, Coleman phrased a summary of the report to emphasize a correlation that recommended racially balanced integration as a reform that eventually might reduce the size of the academic achievement gaps. As he pored over the statistics and test results, Coleman noted that Black children who attended majority-White schools scored higher than other Blacks. The difference was small, but Coleman also gave interviews and filed legal depositions in which he touted the benefits that Black children received when they were dispersed and educated in predominantly White classrooms. This eventually became the most widely reported finding of the Coleman report. “One of the report’s principal conclusions,” the <em>N_ew York </em>Times_ stated, “was that integration was by far the most important school-related factor in improving the achievement of poor children.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:11"" id=""fnref:11"" title=""see footnote"">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Coleman’s integrationist sociology assumed that the quality of a school depended largely on its youth culture and that middle-class schools were better. Since “White” was presumed to be synonymous with “middle class” and “Black” the same as “lower class,” the purpose of integration was to create schools with enough White students to shape the prevailing attitudes and a substantial number of Black children to benefit from being exposed to peers who recognized the importance of schoolwork. Coleman explained that the social composition of a student body influenced academic achievement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting next to a child who is performing at a high level provides a challenge to better performance. The psychological environment may be less comfortable for a lower-class child … but he learns more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Coleman, predominantly-Black schools were problematic because Black students did not offer one another as much beneficial peer stimulation as was available in mostly White schools. And this was important because, Coleman said, the socioeconomic background of fellow students was more important than the quality of teachers or the other resources that schools provided.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:12"" id=""fnref:12"" title=""see footnote"">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Eventually, the Supreme Court joined this chorus. In <em>Green v. New Kent County</em> (1968) and in subsequent opinions of the early 1970s, the High Court redefined “desegregation” to mean what Congress, in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, said it did not mean—“the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial imbalance.” For the next 25 years, the Court held that <em>Brown,</em> when illuminated by modern social science, required the assignment of students by race to ensure that the mix of races at individual schools would be approximately the same as the proportions that existed in the overall school district (and sometimes in an even larger region). The constitutional mandate was changed from prohibiting racial discrimination that separated the races to requiring racial discrimination in order to achieve racial mixture.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:13"" id=""fnref:13"" title=""see footnote"">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It turned out, though, that Coleman’s sociological theorizing missed the mark. The racial differences in test scores persisted when Black and White students were mixed in proportionate numbers</p>
<center><h2>4.</h2></center>
<p>The persistence of the academic achievement gap prompted Coleman to reconsider his research. When he had initially collected data in 1965, Coleman later noted, nearly all the Black children attending integrated schools in the South had been volunteers who had enrolled under freedom-of-choice plans, while almost all integration in the North had occurred in neighborhood schools where Blacks and Whites lived in the same vicinity. The desegregated Black students of 1965 were not representative of Blacks as a group. They were unusual, in that they came disproportionately from middle-class families that considered education important. They had either volunteered to attend mostly White schools or had lived in mostly White neighborhoods. In 1978, Coleman admitted that it had been “wishful thinking” to believe that other Black students would make similar scores if they were integrated under mandatory court orders. Yet Coleman did not have much to recant, for the improvement that he had noted in 1966 had been quite small.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:14"" id=""fnref:14"" title=""see footnote"">[14]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1975, Coleman also came to recognize the significance of an important demographic trend. After analyzing data from 20 large school districts, Coleman concluded that court-ordered busing fostered “resegregation” by increasing the incidence of “White flight.” Coleman reported that the more Blacks enrolled in a school system, the more Whites left. Specifically, he found that after a tipping point had been reached, an increase of five percent in the average White child’s Black classmates would cause an additional 10 percent of White families to leave. Thus the nation faced an insoluble dilemma. There would be no racially balanced integration without court-ordered busing, but such busing had the overall effect of defeating integration. The official push for school integration was offset by the actions of White families who moved from areas where there was a large enrollment of Black students to areas where there was less racial mixing.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:15"" id=""fnref:15"" title=""see footnote"">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After documenting the extent of the flight, Coleman offered an explanation that infuriated erstwhile allies in the civil-rights movement. He said that in the 1960s he had mistakenly assumed that if middle-class students remained in the majority, they would continue to set the tone for an integrated school. “In that situation, both white and black children would learn.” As it happened, however, “the characteristics of the lower-class black classroom” often took over and constituted the values of the integrated school, even if middle-class students remained in the majority. Middle-class parents then transferred their children to private schools or moved to predominantly White suburbs. The problem, Coleman said, was “the degree of disorder and the degree to which schools … have failed to control lower-class black children.” It was “quite understandable,” Coleman said, for middle-class families “not to want to send their children to schools where 90 percent of the time is spent not on instruction but on discipline.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:16"" id=""fnref:16"" title=""see footnote"">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Coleman’s report on on White flight riled integrationists. “In 1966, we cited you as proof that [integration] worked,” NAACP attorney Charles Morgan told Coleman in 1975. “We don’t cite you as proof any more.” Perhaps because Coleman had formerly been their ally, perhaps because he had spoken candidly about the misbehavior of Black students, and perhaps because of fear that Coleman’s comments on White flight would spark additional criticism of racially balanced integration, the NAACP’s chief executive, Roy Wilkins, denounced Coleman’s traitorous “defection.” The civil rights establishment went to work on the media. Ultimately, Coleman’s earlier endorsement of activist integration became a meme in popular discourse, whereas his mature reassessment was ignored. In 1966, journalists lauded Coleman’s first report as “firm evidence” for busing and generally treated Coleman himself “as a giant in his field, a social scientist with a progressive agenda.” Then, after Coleman’s report on White flight, liberal thought leaders “turned hostile,” “questioned [Coleman’s] findings, ”and “frequently quoted critics.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:17"" id=""fnref:17"" title=""see footnote"">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One of these critics was Alfred McClung Lee, the president of the American Sociological Association. Lee used his position to denounce Coleman at a press conference and then asked the Ethics Committee of the association to censure Coleman. Still later, Lee asked the general membership of the organization to condemn Coleman (which never occurred). Coleman eventually confronted his critics at a plenary session of the association, at which the walls were plastered with posters bearing his name, Nazi swastikas, and various epithets. For some time thereafter, Coleman suffered through what he called “a tortured period of intellectual isolation.” “We should not forget,“ he later wrote, “how strong the consensus was at that time among social scientists that bussing was an unalloyed benefit, and a policy not to be questioned.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:18"" id=""fnref:18"" title=""see footnote"">[18]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Despite White flight, most civil-rights activists persisted with demands for racially balanced Integration. In 1984, Jennifer Hochschild, then a professor at Princeton, called for “democracy” to give way to “liberalism.” Since many middle-class parents would not voluntarily send their children to racially balanced schools, Hochschild urged courts to insist that they do so. Quoting John Dewey, Hochschild maintained, “What the best and wisest parent wants for his child, that must the community want for all its children.” If most Americans would not choose to have racially balanced schools, “they must permit elites to make that choice for them.” James Liebman, a Columbia professor who worked on several school-integration cases for the NAACP, explained that one goal was to withdraw control from parents and give children “a wider range of choices about the persons with whom they might associate and the values they might adopt as they approach adulthood.” According to Liebman, a principal purpose of busing was to deny parents the right to send their children to schools that would reinforce “the personal features and values those parents have chosen as their own.” Liebman urged the government to protect the “autonomy” of children from the “tyranny” of parents. The state should make sure that children were exposed to “a broader range of value options than their parents could hope to provide.” According to Liebman, “family life” was too often “marked by exclusiveness, suspicion and jealousy as to those without.” In 2006, 563 social scientists signed a statement that assured the Supreme Court that racially balanced integration improved the “critical thinking skills” and boosted the “achievement levels of African American students.” <sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:19"" id=""fnref:19"" title=""see footnote"">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>By then, however, the Court recognized that this was wishful thinking. With polite understatement, in 2007 Chief Justice John Roberts noted that social science had evolved, and many leading scholars had expressed doubt about “whether racial diversity in schools in fact has a marked impact on test scores … or achieves intangible socialization benefits.” In a landmark decision, <em>Parents Involved v. Seattle</em> (2007)<em>,</em> the Court proceeded to end court-ordered busing with a ringing declaration that <em>Brown</em> meant what it said: the Constitution required public schools to assign pupils on “a racially nondiscriminatory basis.” “History will be heard,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” The Roberts Court belatedly recognized points that Justice Lewis Powell had noted back in 1973; that many parents regarded busing for racial balance as an interference with “the concept of community” and with the “liberty to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:20"" id=""fnref:20"" title=""see footnote"">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, James Coleman somehow managed to survive the criticism of his academic peers. His standing as a sociologist remained high, and eventually he became the president of the American Sociological Association. Accepting an award in 1988, Coleman acknowledged that “recognition by one’s fellow researchers is one of the highest honors that can be bestowed.” Yet he also recalled that it had been difficult to withstand the criticism of peers, and he lamented that others, including “some of the most original and brilliant sociologists,” had been “driven to the periphery or to adjacent disciplines because the implication of their work runs counter to the current intellectual fashion.” In the academic world, Coleman noted, “the threat posed by fellow faculty members is probably greater than that posed by the usual villains.” In academia, academic freedom had been constricted less by external pressures, from either the Right or Left, and more by fellow scholars who were predisposed against research that challenged the conventional wisdom of the liberal mainstream.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:21"" id=""fnref:21"" title=""see footnote"">[21]</a></sup> </p>
<center><h2>5.</h2></center>
<p>After the demise of court-ordered busing for racial balance, egalitarian reformers believed they had no choice but to experiment with other school reforms. Despite desegregation, equalized funding, and busing for racial balance, the racial and ethnic achievement gaps remained almost as large in the 21st century as they had been in 1950. And so reformers continued to grapple with the problem. Most grouped around one or the other of two familiar approaches: progressivism and traditionalism.</p>
<p>For several decades, Jonathan Kozol has been the nation’s best-selling education writer and one of America’s most prominent progressives. Kozol’s 1967 book, <em>Death at an Early Age,</em> enjoyed phenomenal success, with sales eventually amounting to more than two million copies. If one judges by the number of times a book is cited in judicial opinions, Kozol’s <em>Savage Inequalities</em> (1991) was even more influential. <em>Shame of the Nation</em> (2005) completed a major trilogy of works that presented three progressive recommendations for improving the education of African-Americans.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:22"" id=""fnref:22"" title=""see footnote"">[22]</a></sup> One was a call for taxpayers to provide still more money for inner-city schools. As has been noted, racial equality in school funding had become a <em>fait accompli</em> by the time James Coleman conducted his research in 1965–66, but in the 1980s and 1990s, Kozol and other progressive reformers went to court and, in a series of what were called “equity” and “adequacy” lawsuits, persuaded some judges to require additional funding in communities where the state constitution assured citizens that the state would provide “an adequate public education.” As Kozol explained, “Equity does not mean equal funds for unequal needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we budgeted education in accord with the real needs of children … inner-city children … would be getting considerably more than the suburbs and possibly even more than white rural districts… .</p>
<p>If funds were allocated according to the real needs of children … New York City would get $15,000 [per pupil] a year and Great Neck [a prosperous suburb in Long Island] could get by on $7,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kozol believed that school reform required an increase in “money transfer,” and he acknowledged, “When wealthy districts indicate that they see the hand of Robin Hood in this, they are clear sighted and correct.”</p>
<p>In some communities, equalization was accomplished through the democratic process, but in places where communities opposed the process, courts often stepped in and ordered that spending in disproportionately Black schools should exceed the average for a state. Even this “compensatory spending,” however, did not reduce racial and ethnic achievement gaps. In Cambridge Massachusetts, Hartford Connecticut, Camden New Jersey, and several other cities, there was little improvement despite the extra expenditures. In Kansas City, Missouri, where the expenditures for Black education were especially generous, three times as large as the expenditure per pupil in some mostly White school districts in the state, the average test scores of Black students actually declined.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:23"" id=""fnref:23"" title=""see footnote"">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The second arrow in Kozol’s quiver aimed for busing for racial balance, but, as noted, the Supreme Court eventually ruled against this policy.</p>
<p>Kozol’s third remedy, however, was widely implemented. It called for teachers to have more empathy for Black students, and for curriculum planners to design less prescriptive courses of study. Thanks in large part to Kozol’s influence, for more than a generation, teachers were taught to emphasize the importance of caring for minority students and cultivating their self-esteem.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:24"" id=""fnref:24"" title=""see footnote"">[24]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The journalist Rita Kramer emphasized this point, after spending the academic year 1988–89 visiting schools of education throughout the United States, sitting in on classes, talking with faculty and students, and visiting the schools where education students did their practice teaching. Kramer found that Kozol’s book (along with the works of other like-minded education writers) “permeated the ed school world.” At Columbia Teachers College, the professors talked about “things like feeling, warmth, [and] empathy more than … about skills, training, discipline.” At one education school after another, the emphasis was on promoting the self-confidence of students, on inculcating positive self-images, on encouraging respect for others from all cultural backgrounds. Rather than stress the importance of transmitting academic knowledge, the schools of education were training teachers to work with students “in egalitarian ways, respecting diversity and integrating everyone for the future of our country.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:25"" id=""fnref:25"" title=""see footnote"">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Like most progressives, Kozol also called for a less prescriptive, more joyful curriculum. Kozol acknowledged that Black and Hispanic students should learn essential skills. But he strongly opposed the periodic testing of students in math and reading. He recognized the need for inner-city students to catch up with their higher-performing peers. But he complained that standardized testing led to “teaching for the test” and turned schools “into places not of learning but of robot-like memorization and military style discipline.” It led to teachers becoming “drill sergeants” and students “examination soldiers.” Kozol said he would not have opposed an emphasis on testing if this approach actually improved the students’ ability to read and compute. But, he said, this emphasis did “not work except for the lowest-scoring children in a class and, even then, the gains that they achieve sustain themselves for only a brief period of time. These are testing gains, not learning gains.” According to Kozol, the gains were an artifact of “nonstop drilling for exams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the gains were real, they would have persisted into high school, but only half the youths in many inner cities ever became high-school seniors and these students were, on average, still reading and computing, “at the level of the average white seventh-grader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When people said that direct instruction and test preparation were working, Kozol told one reporter, they were “telling a terrible lie to the parents of poor children.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:26"" id=""fnref:26"" title=""see footnote"">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Kozol came in for criticism when he opposed standardized testing. Thus Whitney Tilson, a hedge-fund manager and a leader of a group called Democrats for Education Reform, asked,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t Kozol realize that while [standardized testing] may have some warts and needs to be tweaked, it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to disadvantaged children? For the first time, school systems can no longer sweep these children under the rug and are FINALLY being measured, which is the first requirement of accountability… .</p>
<p>It’s precisely BECAUSE kids who haven’t had many advantages are so far behind that testing is NECESSARY. Without testing, how is anyone to know how far behind they are? [Without testing] how can a hue and cry be raised, how can we get extra help for these kids?<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:27"" id=""fnref:27"" title=""see footnote"">[27]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After noting that Kozol’s books were “still widely read in ed schools and by activist teachers,” another critic, journalist Sol Stern, opined that, to the degree teachers subscribed to Kozol’s progressive views, they would “limit the life chances of inner-city children.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:28"" id=""fnref:28"" title=""see footnote"">[28]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Despite criticism, from about 1960 to 2000, most school reform “gap closers” stuck to the playbook of progressive education. While acknowledging that inner-city students needed to learn essential skills, most progressives strongly opposed the testing that was supposed to help weak students catch up with their higher performing peers. Instead, progressives stressed the need for schools that exuded informality and warmth, camaraderie and playfulness. In addition, because testing and grouping students by ability had the effect of “resegregating” pupils, with Whites disproportionately being assigned to more advanced classes, progressives insisted that the full range of students should be placed in the same classroom. When the resulting mix included students who were reading or computing at markedly different levels, teachers discovered that they could no longer teach the class as a whole. Progressives then recommended that teachers adjust to heterogeneous classes by using new methods that were recommended as especially appropriate for integrated classrooms—methods such as “peer tutoring” and “cooperative learning.” Progressives urged schools to turn away from “teacher-centered instruction” and to embrace “student-centered learning.”</p>
<p>Teachers were encouraged to eschew the role of master or mistress of ceremonies and instead become facilitators of “discovery” projects that allowed individual students to explore and to learn on their own. The ideal instructor was no longer a “sage on the stage” but a “guide on the side.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:29"" id=""fnref:29"" title=""see footnote"">[29]</a></sup> </p>
<center><h2>6.</h2></center>
<p>Inevitably, there was a backlash when, as with the previous reforms, progressive approaches failed to close the racial and ethnic achievement gaps. The backlash initially manifested itself in demands for direct instruction and a standard curriculum. Arthur Jensen, a University of California psychologist best known for his research on intelligence (IQ), was one of the most prominent scholars who emphasized the importance of direct instruction. Writing in the <em>Harvard Educational Review</em> in 1969, Jensen reported that “wherever they have been tried … compensatory education programs” had failed to close the racial achievement gap. But Jensen also insisted, “All the basic scholastic skills can be learned by children with normal learning ability.” He further speculated that non-Asian minority children were lagging because their schools were using progressive approaches that stressed the importance of “understanding” and “conceptual learning.” Jensen said that a disproportionate number of Black students were not advancing because their teachers were using methods that were at odds with the “genetic and cultural heritage” of African-Americans. According to Jensen, children with low IQs and children who were disadvantaged in terms of cultural background or socioeconomic circumstances had “different … modes of learning.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If diversity of mental abilities, as of most other human characteristics, is a basic fact of nature … it seems a reasonable conclusion that schools and society must provide a range and diversity of educational methods… . The ideal of equality of educational opportunity should not be interpreted as uniformity of … instructional techniques… . Diversity rather than uniformity of approaches … would seem to be the key to making education rewarding for children of different patterns of ability.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:30"" id=""fnref:30"" title=""see footnote"">[30]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without acknowledging indebtedness to Jensen, several influential school reformers picked up on this theme. One was Robert Slavin, a Johns Hopkins psychologist who established a widely-adopted program called Success For All (SFA). In some ways, Slavin was a progressive. But when it came to the best method for teaching reading, Slavin rejected the conventional wisdom of progressive education. For decades, educators had debated whether it was better to present information and teach skills directly or to allow children to discover them on their own. Most progressives preferred non-directive, student-centered teaching methods that allowed children to learn at their own pace, with teachers acting as facilitators, as guides rather than as authoritative instructors. Progressives stressed the importance of exposing students to interesting stories, saying that if the students’ interests were engaged they would become enthusiastic about school and would automatically learn how to read. Progressives opposed memorization and drill, which they said would stifle students’ budding interests and cause them to emotionally reject school. Traditionalists, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of phonics and the need for students to sound out words by memorizing the sounds of letters and combinations of letters. Traditionalists, in addition, accused progressives of having a romantic view of learning, one that was imbued with love and hope but, sadly, left many children uncomprehending, without the ability to read.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:31"" id=""fnref:31"" title=""see footnote"">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1986 Baltimore’s superintendent of schools asked Slavin to design a program for disadvantaged elementary school students. Slavin then reviewed the literature on reading and discovered that a gulf separated the conventional wisdom of progressives from that of researchers. Progressivism was the fashion in most schools of education, but Slavin reported that the best research “was crystal clear that phonics was more effective.” “Study after study found that children who struggled in reading had to be taught a phonetic, systematic strategy for unlocking the reading code.” Some children admittedly learned to read without phonics, but Slavin concluded that no group of children had been harmed by phonics, whereas “a large group of children” was harmed by the lack of phonics.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:32"" id=""fnref:32"" title=""see footnote"">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>So it was also, Slavin concluded, with other subjects. If disadvantaged students were to learn, they had to be taught systematically. To this end, Slavin’s SFA provided teachers with highly scripted lesson plans that prescribed what to do during almost every minute of a class period. One headline in the <em>New York Times</em> described SFA as “Teaching By the Book”; another in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> declared, “Now Johnny Can Read if Teacher Just Keeps Doing What He’s Told.” Many progressives were appalled. “Highly scripted lessons don’t just handcuff teachers,” complained education writer Alfie Kohn. “They cheat students … by substituting a diet of isolated skills for the thoughtful exploration of ideas.” “Creativity is being stifled,” declared education professor Bob Nathanson, who opposed programs that focused too narrowly on the basics and treated teachers like robots. “A trained monkey could do [SFA],” said Janice Ault, the president of the North Sacramento Education Association.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:33"" id=""fnref:33"" title=""see footnote"">[33]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many school administrators nevertheless defended SFA. “Some critics … will say, ‘Oh my God, you’re lobotomizing teachers,’” said Paul Vallas, who at different times headed the public school systems in Chicago, Philadelphia, and New Orleans. “No. What we’re saying is, ‘What every successful corporation is doing, what the military is doing, is giving teachers a model of quality instruction and curriculum.’” “Instead of everyone trying to figure out their own way in the classroom, which is the way schools used to work,” explained Judith Rizzo, the deputy chancellor for instruction in New York City, “new teachers in particular need a very clearly defined program.” Several federal judges agreed. When handing down decisions in the “equity” and “adequacy” lawsuits mentioned above, one judge after another ordered entire states—New Jersey, Texas, and others—to adopt the SFA program. And in 2010, when the Department of Education chose just four groups from among 1,600 applicants in the competition for “scale up” awards worth $50 million each, Success for All was one of the four. SFA received these endorsements because many judges and government bureaucrats believed that Robert Slavin’s direct instruction program was doing better than rival approaches when it came to teaching elementary school students.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:34"" id=""fnref:34"" title=""see footnote"">[34]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When it came to the importance of having a standard curriculum, however, E. D. Hirsch received even more publicity than Robert Slavin. A professor of English at the University of Virginia and the author of a best-selling book, <em>Cultural Literacy</em> (1987), Hirsch emphasized the importance of what he called “core knowledge.” He noted that most cultures focused on basic acculturation until youths reached an age of about thirteen. At that age Catholics were confirmed, Jews bar or bat mitzvahed, and tribal boys and girls underwent the rites of passage into the tribe.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:35"" id=""fnref:35"" title=""see footnote"">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Similarly, according to Hirsch, familiarity with certain information was also taken for granted in America’s upper spheres, where those who lacked core knowledge did not seem to belong. That was the way things were, and Hirsch wanted to make sure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds had the opportunity to learn what was expected and needed to get ahead. Thus, as Hirsch saw it, the job of elementary and junior high schools was to transmit the basic information needed to thrive in a society, which in practice meant “the transmission to children of the specific information shared by the adults.” Upper-class White youths often picked up the requisite information automatically, because they lived in families that were disproportionately well-to-do and intact. But Black and Latino youths, and many working- and middle-class Whites as well, were less likely to acquire the core knowledge because their family lives were disproportionately disadvantaged, disorganized, or parochial. To address this situation, Hirsch established a Core Knowledge Foundation that produced a packaged plan that specified how teachers and students should spend about 50 percent of their time. By 2010 some 1,184 schools used all or part of what was called the Core Knowledge Curriculum. The curriculum focused on the elementary grades and emphasized the importance of giving students the basic knowledge that was needed as a foundation for more advanced learning.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:36"" id=""fnref:36"" title=""see footnote"">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Progressives criticized Hirsch’s approach, but Hirsch returned fire. According to Hirsch, it was a “tragic paradox” that “the <em>Brown</em> decision which desegregated our schools” was handed down in 1954, shortly before progressive educators “finally succeeded in abolishing the emphasis on traditional academic content in the early grades.” As Hirsch saw it, during the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s, children were being integrated into schools where “the traditional lore necessary to communication and full participation in our society were very inconsistently taught.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the wake of the <em>Brown</em> decision, at the very moment of our highest hopes for social justice, the victory of progressivism over academic content had already foreclosed the chance that school integration would equalize achievement and enhance social justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Progressives dominated American public education, and they “precipitated a social misfortune.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:37"" id=""fnref:37"" title=""see footnote"">[37]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, when busing for racial balance was in vogue, and when direct instruction and traditional curricula were regaining popularity, there was some progress in narrowing the racial achievement gap. But it is hard to know why. Some observers credited busing for the trend. But critics of that policy noted that the trend in academic achievement was similar for all Black students, regardless of whether they were attending schools that were mostly White or entirely Black. Since the test scores of Black students in racially concentrated inner-city schools improved as much as those of Blacks who were attending integrated schools, sociologist David Armor wrote, school integration was “unlikely to have contributed significantly to national black achievement gains.” Critics also noted that when SFA was used, the gains were limited to students in the early grades of elementary school. Meanwhile, students in Core Knowledge schools did well on standardized tests, but these students were not a representative sample, for they were disproportionately the children of parents who cared about education. In any case, during the 1990s the racial gap widened again and, as had been the case with the achievement gains, the retrogression occurred among both integrated and concentrated Black students. In 2000 the racial achievement gap was almost as wide as it had been in 1950.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:38"" id=""fnref:38"" title=""see footnote"">[38]</a></sup> </p>
<center><h2>7.</h2></center>
<p>Despite repeated failures, school reformers did not give up. During the 1990s and into the 21st century yet more reform movements came to the fore. One of the most celebrated was Teach for America (TFA), an organization that was established by Princeton graduate Wendy Kopp. TFA was organized around the idea that the racial and ethnic achievement gaps could be closed if the nation’s public schools recruited more teachers who had high grades, high IQs, high SAT scores, and a fervent commitment to racial uplift. TFA maintained that the test scores of poor Black and Latino students could be improved substantially, but only if their teachers went beyond presenting information clearly and also were especially bright people who invested students with the proper goals and attitudes.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:39"" id=""fnref:39"" title=""see footnote"">[39]</a></sup> </p>
<p>With substantial backing from corporate donors, TFA preached this message so effectively that by 2010, about 12 percent of all Ivy League graduates applied to serve a two-year stint with TFA. In terms of closing the achievement gaps, however, the overall results were disappointing. Millions of dollars were allocated for studies that compared the test scores of students who were taught by TFA recruits and the test scores of students taught by regular teachers. The results were ambiguous. Some studies reported that the TFA’s students did a little better, and some studies reported the opposite. In either case, the differences were small. In a 2009 speech to the Commonwealth Club of California, Wendy Kopp acknowledged, “If you look at the data on the aggregate level, the achievement gap has not closed at all in the last twenty years.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:40"" id=""fnref:40"" title=""see footnote"">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One TFA spin-off, however, enjoyed considerable success. Founded by TFA alumni Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin, the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) emphasized the importance of a traditional curriculum, a longer school day, and preparation for standardized tests. KIPP also developed an innovative system of rewards and punishments that simultaneously fostered a positive attitude toward school work and an understanding that bad behavior would not be tolerated. KIPP’s students regularly scored above the level registered by other students with similar racial and socio-economic backgrounds, although this still left some disparity between the achievement of KIPP’s students and the national averages for White and Asian students.</p>
<p>The KIPP academies, however, were not typical schools. Feinberg and Levin understood that a few disruptive students could destroy the education of all the other children in a class. Therefore, the KIPP academies were open only to students who observed KIPP’s strict disciplinary policies. And there was more. To attend a KIPP academy, students had to accept a longer school day and year, and their parents had to agree to check their children’s homework every night and to make sure that their children followed the KIPP dress code. By 2013, KIPP enrolled about 50,000 students in 141 schools, almost all of which were elementary or middle schools. It was not likely that KIPP would be brought to a much larger scale, but KIPP did offer a superior education for the students it enrolled. Some of the success, however, should be attributed to the unrepresentative nature of KIPP’s students and parents.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:41"" id=""fnref:41"" title=""see footnote"">[41]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When TFA began, Wendy Kopp said underachieving minority students would do better if they had outstanding teachers. KIPP did the same. Then, during the first decade of the 21st century, the emphasis in school reform shifted. Instead of praising special teachers, reformers increasingly attributed the achievement gaps to schools that were bad because bad teachers’ unions supposedly made it difficult for schools to fire bad teachers. In time, the “bad unions, bad teachers, bad schools” idea (what pundit Steve Sailer called the Three Bads Theory) became the conventional wisdom among an influential group of school reformers who believed that “choice” and “accountability” could close the gaps. In some quarters, these reformers were called “corporate reformers,” because much of their work was subsidized by “billionaire boys” such as Bill Gates, Eli Broad, and Jack Welch.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:42"" id=""fnref:42"" title=""see footnote"">[42]</a></sup> </p>
<p>By “choice,” the corporate reformers meant increasing the number of publicly funded charter schools that would provide able and industrious students with an alternative to regular neighborhood public schools. By “accountability,” they meant using standardized tests to measure the achievement of students and also for rating and paying teachers according to how well their students did on standardized tests. As explained in one report from the Brookings Institution, teachers should be rewarded or punished according the “value” they added to their students. Instead of increasing the salaries of teachers as they gained seniority or earned advanced degrees—which was the policy in most school districts—corporate reformers and some academic reformers proposed a two-step program. First, they would create data systems that could track the teachers. Then, they would dismiss teachers whose students scored in the bottom 25 percent on standardized tests. They would keep only those teachers who could demonstrate success on the job by increasing the scores their students made on standardized tests. In this way, schools supposedly would have a staff of great teachers because all the bad teachers would be gone. This approach came to be known as the value-added model (VAM) for assessing teachers.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:43"" id=""fnref:43"" title=""see footnote"">[43]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In its Race to the Top Program, the administration of President Barack Obama used federal funding to promote the VAM method. But the teachers’ unions were opposed, as were many students and parents who complained about excessive testing and a loss of local control over education. Some skeptics even questioned the motives of the reformers. They said that well-to-do philanthropists had embraced VAM because, as Bill Gates once explained, VAM tacitly challenged “the myth that we have to solve poverty before we improve education… . It’s more the other way around: Improving education is the best way to solve poverty.” VAM’s critics interpreted this to mean that corporate reformers thought there was no need for higher taxes to allow more spending for education. For VAM reformers, firing bad teachers was the key to closing the racial and ethnic achievement gaps. VAM reformers had no fixed opinions about the curriculum or teaching methods, but they recommended bonuses for teachers whose Black and Latino students performed well on standardized tests. And they insisted that many other teachers, those whose students continued to lag on the tests, should be fired.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:44"" id=""fnref:44"" title=""see footnote"">[44]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Some school superintendents did their best to implement the philosophy of the VAM model. One of these reformers, Whitney Tilson, candidly explained the rationale. According to Tilson, “every study shows that teacher quality matters far more than anything else when it comes to student learning and achievement.” “The key factor” responsible for racial and ethnic achievement gaps was “that most poor kids are forced to attend mediocre to catastrophically bad schools and are taught by way too many mediocre to catastrophically bad teachers.” “The problem is not too many bad kids, it’s too many bad schools.” The solution is to “fire bad teachers.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:45"" id=""fnref:45"" title=""see footnote"">[45]</a></sup> </p>
<p>At first the evidence from the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) seemed to support an indictment of America’s schools. In this international comparison, the average scores of American students were in the middle range—behind the scores registered in Northeast Asia and Western Europe but ahead of the scores in most of the rest of the world. MSNBC reported that students in the United States were trailing “behind their peers in a pack of higher performing nations… . Out of 34 countries assessed, the U.S. ranked 14th in reading, 17th in science, 25th in math.” And school reformers then spread an alarm. Chester Finn characterized the release of the PISA scores in 2010 as another “Sputnik moment.” “Sixty-three years [ago] … Sputnik caused an earthquake in American education by giving us reason to believe that the Soviet Union had surpassed us.” And now PISA allegedly showed that other nations were “bent on surpassing us … in education.” President Obama concurred, saying, “Our generation’s Sputnik moment is back.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:46"" id=""fnref:46"" title=""see footnote"">[46]</a></sup> </p>
<p>But this point of view came under attack when statisticians “disaggregated” the test scores. In turned out that, when the PISA scores were broken down by race and ethnicity, and when American students were compared with students in the countries from which theAmericans’ ancestors came,Asian-Americans outperformed the students in all Asian nations; White Americans did better than students from all 37 predominantly White nations (except Finland); U.S. Hispanics scored higher than the students of all eight Latin American countries that participated in the PISA tests; and Black Americans outperformed the only Black country that participated, Trinidad and Tobago, and probably would have outscored any sub-Saharan African country if any had participated in the PISA testing.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:47"" id=""fnref:47"" title=""see footnote"">[47]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The results of the PISA testing precipitated a schism in the ranks of the corporate reformers. Some continued to say that all would be well if bad teachers were weeded out and good teachers were rewarded with extra pay. But thanks to PISA, others sensed that American teachers and schools were not doing a bad job. This, however, did not lead reformers to give up on their cause; instead, many came to think that the problem with school reforms was that they came too late to make much difference. Persistent reformers emphasized a point that skeptics had long noted: that at the age of 5 or 6, when most students began kindergarten or first grade, the average Black student already scored below 85 percent of the Whites, and the proportion of the African-Americans scoring below the White median hardly budged over the course of the next 12 years. Taking this into account, some reformers ceased blaming teachers and instead shifted their emphasis to early childhood education and to reforming the quality of parenting in Black and Hispanic families. They said Black and Hispanic children were victims of dysfunctional family environments. They said ethnic and racial achievement gaps could be closed if reformers could teach non-Asian minority parents how to interact with their 2-, 3-, and 4-year- olds. This, indeed, has become the prevailing wisdom among reformers as of this writing (summer 2015). One observer, Robert Weissberg, likened this new emphasis on early childhood education to what he called “the gambler’s fallacy”; this is the phenomenon that some gamblers, after having repeatedly lost on wagers, mistakenly believe they are “due” for a success that will wipe out all previous losses. So it seems with desperate gap closers. Despite the failure of so many previous school reforms, they refuse to concede the futility of their enterprise. Instead, they say that racial and ethnic achievement gaps will be closed if Black and Latino children are liberated from their dysfunctional family environments.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:48"" id=""fnref:48"" title=""see footnote"">[48]</a></sup> </p>
<center><h2>8.</h2></center>
<p>Questions arise. Why do most reformers persist despite so many failures? Why do they continue to devise one nostrum after another? Why have they ignored the importance of IQ? Why do they persist in the face of Darwinian theory and biological and genetic evidence that points to the inevitability of achievement gaps? For many years after publication of <em>Origin of the Species</em> (1859), increasing numbers of educated Europeans and Americans believed that racial differences were the result of evolutionary adaptations; that mankind separated into several parts in the distant past, with one part inhabiting the ancestral homeland in sub-Saharan Africa and other groups crossing into Southwest Asia and then separating again and again until there were human populations living in reproductive isolation from one another in almost all regions of the world. This continued for hundreds of generations and, over time, there were numerous adaptations to differing climates and conditions. Opinions differed as to the full extent of these adaptations, but no one doubted that they went beyond changes in skin color. They include differences in musculature and brain size and different sequences in genes that influence behavior, intelligence, and personality. Earlier generations understood that nature was not stupid. They knew that different groups had developed different aptitudes that were suited to their respective environments.</p>
<p>Yet this traditional wisdom was forgotten when the civil-rights movement transformed America. By the time this writer attended college in the 1950s, most social scientists affirmed that “culture” was more influential than genes or race in determining the behavior of individuals or groups; that “ opportunities” were more important than “biology.” In the 1950s and 1960s, after <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> and after the Civil Rights Act, “culturists” became dominant in shaping public policy, while “biologians” were consigned to laboratories, where they were expected to work on discrete problems but not to probe into biological explanations of human differences. In 1956, one of my favorite professors at the University of California, Kenneth M. Stampp, summed up the then-prevailing view in memorable language: “Negroes are after all only white men with black skins, nothing more, nothing less.” Professor Stampp and most other professors of his time subscribed to what is now called The Doctrine of Zero Group Differences (DZGD). This is the idea that all important aptitudes are distributed equally among all large groups of people, and the complementary idea that if a sizeable group is under- or over-represented in any important way, the disparity is not due to inherent traits but to discrimination or privilege, or perhaps to the accidents of history, climate, geography, or culture. Since the 1950s, the great majority of scholars in the relevant fields have either maintained silence or have openly rejected the idea that Darwinian evolution endowed different groups with different distributions of aptitude and ability. Instead, they have demanded an end to policies that have a disparate negative impact on non-White groups.</p>
<p>History is rife with false beliefs that are deeply held despite strong evidence to the contrary. Sometimes false beliefs are held even if they are at odds with common sense. My father, who fought in the First World War, and my paternal grandfather, who farmed virgin land in Kansas, were not disciples of Charles Darwin. But they believed that racial differences were obvious and consequential. They disapproved of bigots and told me to treat everyone respectfully. But they also knew there was a difference between equality of opportunity for individuals and equality of results for groups. They sensed something that has become ever more apparent with the passage of time: that the different races of mankind <em>inherently</em> differ statistically in the distribution of certain traits. My own generation was taught the opposite; that any statistical differences are the result of privilege, discrimination, or lack of opportunity. But what about my grandchildren and their progeny? What will they think? It’s hard to know. My hope is that they will become acquainted with modern research in the social and genetic sciences. If they do, they will understand that social reform that attempts to usurp human nature will inevitably fail. They will understand why one reform after another has failed to close the racial and ethnic gaps in academic achievement. They will understand that the United States of my time was in the grip of what John Derbyshire has called “a collective delusion.” And when they understand all that, the opinions of my grandchildren and great grandchildren will resemble those of my father and grandfather more closely than those that have prevailed in the United States since the 1950s.</p>

</h2>
<p>Enormous strides have been made in recent years in unraveling the evolutionary basis of human nature. Among other thing, this work totally undermines the Behaviorist view that everything human is environmentally determined. Behaviorism, for decades, hindered serious progress in the social sciences; it is well that it be put to rest. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the pervasive influence of Cultural Marxism and the tactics of its adherents have prevented evolutionary approaches from spreading widely in the human sciences. This is apparent in the persistent rejection of any discussion of the biological basis of human racial differences, nowhere more so than in issues relating to IQ. This rejection in unfazed by the fact that there are few, if any, constructs in the social sciences more powerful than IQ. It correlates with and predicts an extremely wide range of social phenomena including, but not limited to, school and economic performance, criminal behavior, differences in wealth between nations, and demographic groups within nations. Among research psychologists this is well known and not particularly controversial. Equally well-known is that, based on decades of research, IQ is, in large measure, genetically determined. </p>
<p>Among elite opinion makers, however, the importance and predictive power of IQ is denied, as is the idea that it is genetically based. This denial is completely at variance with 100 years of research on IQ and the consensus opinion among research scientists. For example, the American Psychological Association (APA), in response to the controversy surrounding <em>The Bell Curve</em>, created a task force to examine the questions raised, and in 1996 acknowledged the validity and reliability of IQ tests. In addition, the task force also endorsed the idea that IQ is, to a significant extent, heritable, though it remained agnostic on the issue of genetically determined racial differences.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn1"" id=""ffn1"">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The practical value of IQ is indicated by the reliance in recruitment by two of the nation’s most important institutions upon measures that are, for all intents and purposes, IQ tests. Colleges make extensive use of SAT and ACT scores in the admission process. Both of these tests correlate very highly with IQ tests. Likewise, the United States armed forces use the AFQT (Armed Forces Qualifying Test) in selecting recruits. The test is based on performance on four subtests—Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), and Mathematics Knowledge (MK). Given the similarity of the abilities measured by the AFQT and standard IQ tests, it is hardly surprising that the two are highly correlated. Both college admissions tests and the AFQT are regularly used by researchers as reliable proxies for IQ tests.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most intellectuals eschew the idea that important human characteristics and abilities are genetically determined. The reasons are plain, since for at least from the late 1960s, the social sciences and humanities have been dominated by self-conscious egalitarians. The journalist John Derbyshire has called one of the central beliefs of such academics the Dogma of Zero Group Differences, or DZGD; it holds that there there are no inherent human characteristics; human nature is a social construct. In this view, human behavior is culturally determined and the product of social and class conditioning. It follows that, barring certain inconvenient social distinctions, all people must be equal in their abilities and temperament; at the very least, they possess equal human potential. Therefore, any differences in economic or social status are the result of the social conditioning, and more often than not, attributed to the exploitation of the powerless by ruling elites. The powerless are, in this view, induced to accept their oppression because they have been indoctrinated by the ruling class into thinking that their inferior status is the necessary result of their inferior abilities. Put another way the working class is induced to accept the false understanding (false consciousness) that modern societies are meritocratic rather than organized and manipulated to benefit those in power.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Evolutionary explanations undercut this view since, from the evolutionary perspective, a substantial number of human characteristics must be determined by genes shaped by thousands of years of natural selection. Given the demonstrable reality of natural selection and the resultant evolution that it creates, the notion that the human mind is a “blank slate” is simply untenable.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">[3]</a></sup> Nevertheless this conclusion is rejected by most all of the left-right spectrum, including many of those who claim to believe in evolution. </p>
<p>The dogmatic rejection of any genetic explanations for human difference was glaringly revealed in the left’s response to the publication in 1975 of <em>Sociobiology</em> by the eminent Harvard entomologist Edward O. Wilson.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn4"" id=""ffn4"">[4]</a></sup> Wilson argued that the nature of animal social behavior, including human social behavior, was governed by the same rules of evolution that shaped all the other features of living things; that human behavior is not immune to natural law and that, in effect, there is a human nature that cannot be easily modified by social conditioning. From this view, boys like guns and girls like dolls, because that is the way they are and no amount of conditioning can erase that difference. </p>
<p>Wilson came under attack by the aptly named Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People, an attack vigorously supported by the well-known left-wing scientists Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin. The Study Group did not simply claim that Wilson was mistaken in his science, but that his position was morally tainted and a barely hidden assertion of the inferiority of various non-White racial groups. The fact that Wilson never discussed racial differences in his book (race does not appear anywhere in the index) did not exonerate him from the charge of malicious intent. Wilson’s critics argued that evolutionary explanations survive because “they consistently provide a genetic justification of the status quo and of existing privileges for certain groups according to class, race or sex.” His book betrayed “the personal and social class prejudice of the author.” And he joins a “long parade “ of those “whose work has served to buttress the institutions of their society by exonerating them from responsibility for social problems.” <sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn5"" id=""ffn5"">[5]</a></sup> Wilson was hounded for many years by student demonstrators and was often prevented from speaking before university audiences. In one well-known incident at a 1978 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, ”antagonists commandeered the podium as Wilson was scheduled to speak, delivered a five-minute diatribe against him and his works, and concluded by pouring a pitcher of water over him. . . .” <sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn6"" id=""ffn6"">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>It should be stressed that that this was an extreme reaction against any claim for the biological basis for human differences. Many social scientists accepted the reality of human biological differences at the level of the individual. However, no such explanations were acceptable for differences between groups. If groups differ, on average, in income or school performance or rates of crime or illegitimacy, these must be due to differential treatment by society and, in particular, to the ethnocentrism, racism and sexism of the majority White population. This view on racial differences emerged in the 1960s and had, by the 1970s, become an unchallengeable orthodoxy, even in supposedly conservative circles and remains so to this day, now under the guise of political correctness.</p>
<p>The fate of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray’s book, <em>The Bell Curve</em>, which came out about 20 years after Wilson’s book, is instructive.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn7"" id=""ffn7"">[7]</a></sup> The main thesis of the book was that group differences in social and economic success could be based, in large measure, on genetic causes. That book, which spent 15 weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> best-seller list in 1994-95, has dropped down the memory hole in elite academic circles, even though at the time it was a major focus of controversy. In 1994, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published a statement by noted educational researcher Linda Gottfredson, and endorsed by a large number of individuals readily recognized as the most illustrious researchers in psychology and related fields. Quoting Gottfredson: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the publication of <em>The Bell Curve</em>, many commentators have offered opinions about human intelligence that misstate current scientific evidence. Some conclusions dismissed in the media as discredited are actually firmly supported. The following conclusions are fully described in the major textbooks, professional journals and encyclopedias in intelligence. Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings—“catching on,” “making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do. . . . Intelligence, so defined, can be measured, and intelligence tests measure it well.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn8"" id=""ffn8"">[8]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 20 years since <em>The Bell Curve</em> was published, the suppression of the fundamental truths in that book grows even more outrageous. Charles Murray is hardly exaggerating when he argues that in academia, “assistant professors know that their chances of getting tenure will be close to zero if they publish politically incorrect findings on climate change, homosexuality, race differences, gender differences, or renewable energy.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn9"" id=""ffn9"">[9]</a></sup> Simply adopting incorrect views is, in academia, to be ostracized and shunned by colleagues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of suppression of dissent has infiltrated all walks of life and has had a poisonous effect on the onetime valued ideal of a free exchange of ideas. For instance, in addressing Black-White gaps in education one must claim to believe that such differences are always attributable to social causes and never to any inherent characteristics of individuals. For instance, if Black children are disciplined more frequently in school, it can only be attributed to teachers’ biases. It can never be due to the fact that Black children are many times more likely to engage in criminal acts on the streets when not in school, and do not drop their propensities simply by walking through the schoolhouse door.</p>
<p>To argue that group differences have their basis in genetics is to jeopardize one’s career. The case of the otherwise impeccably leftist Lawrence Summers teaches us a great deal. This economist was forced to resign as president of Harvard University in 2006 for suggesting a possible genetic explanation for differences in scientific achievement between the sexes. His suggestion is hardly exceptional, and, in fact, is based on well-established research that has been well-known for years, namely that most characteristics are more widely distributed among men than among women; i.e., there are more males than females at the extreme tails, top and bottom, of the bell curve. Therefore it is perfectly reasonable to argue that among those scientists who have made extraordinary contributions, there are likely to be more men than women.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn10"" id=""ffn10"">[10]</a></sup> Before assuming the presidency at Harvard, Summers had been a major economic advisor in the Clinton administration, and after leaving Harvard served in the Obama administration and was the key economic decision-maker in President Obama’s response to the recession of 2007-2008. The fact that he was a respected economist, and one who had served in a liberal Democratic administration, provided him no immunity from the wrath of those who deny the reality of human biological differences.  </p>
<p>Nobel laureate geneticist James Watson, one of the most celebrated scientists of our time, came under virulent attack for expressing a forbidden opinion on race. In a long interview published in the <em>London Sunday Times</em>, Watson commented on Western policies with respect to Africa that “are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours—whereas all the testing says not really.” Further, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]here is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of people geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically. Our wanting to preserve equal powers of reason as some universal human heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He suggested that new approaches were probably needed to help Africans escape their unfortunate circumstances. For these perfectly defensible statements, he was widely vilified and relieved of his duties at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He had been its director for 35 years and under his leadership it became a world-leading center for basic research in cancer and molecular biology.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn11"" id=""ffn11"">[11]</a></sup> In late 2014, Watson revealed that he was selling his Nobel Prize because he was short of cash and “no-one really wants to admit I exist.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn12"" id=""ffn12"">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The fate of lesser-known individuals who deviate from egalitarian orthodoxy is not so widely publicized. Christopher Brand, a highly respected British scholar published a book on group IQ differences that produced such uproar among his critics that his publishers cancelled his contract and went so far as to recall all the books it had already distributed to bookstores. He was subsequently dismissed from his position at Edinburg University, although the university eventually settled with him for unlawful dismissal.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn13"" id=""ffn13"">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, deviating from accepted opinion about universal natural equality and biological sameness results in ostracism or loss of employment. In countries that lack free-speech protections, dissenting from the accepted views is criminalized. J. Philippe Rushton was investigated by the Ontario police for possible prosecution for a paper he presented on racial differences at an academic conference in 1989. According to Jonathan Rauch, writing in <em>Reason</em> magazine, the police “launched a six-month investigation of Rushton under Canada's hate-speech prohibition. They questioned his colleagues, demanded tapes of his debates and media appearances, and so on."" If prosecuted and convicted, Rushton might have been imprisoned for two year for “using questionable source data.” Rauch explains, ”In the end, the attorney general decided not to prosecute and settled for denouncing Rushton’s ideas as ‘loony.’”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn14"" id=""ffn14"">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>All of these sanctions serve to intimidate those who question the prevalent egalitarian dogma and they appear to be working as planned. To quote Murray “We will never know what scientific work was avoided by scientists who wish to avoid the scorn, harassment and ostracism that will result if they discover something that contradicts the prevailing view.”(Murray, “In Defense of Jason Richwine.) For those academics without tenure, the penalty for dissenting views or research that reveals uncomfortable findings will result in the denial of tenure and very likely in the denial of positions elsewhere. They are, in fact, driven from positions they have devoted years to obtain and deprived of their very livelihood. For young instructors supporting or helping to support families such risks are unacceptably high. </p>
<p>Until now, physical scientists have not had to contend with political correctness, but that is changing. The completion of the mapping of the human genome and very recent advances in the ability to decode individual genes has led many scientists to explore genetic components of disease, including racial differences in disease patterns. This research has not always been welcomed, even though it promises to lead to better diagnosis of diseases, which are more common in some races, and in better treatments, some of which are more effective in some races than in others.</p>
<p>University of Chicago geneticist Bruce Lahn came under fire for publishing an important finding that two genes implicated in brain size (and perhaps intelligence) were more common among people from Asia and Europe but uncommon among people from Africa. One of the genes seems to have arisen about 40,000 years ago, roughly at the time when the first modern humans are thought to have appeared in Europe. The other gene was found mainly in people from Europe and the Middle East and was thought to have arisen about 6,000 years ago. Lahn speculated that the first may have been selected for conditions in northern latitudes and the second may have been the product of, or the explanation for, large-scale agriculture and the rise of early civilizations. The clear implication of Lahn’s research is that these may be among those many genes thought to influence the various differences between the three large racial groups found in Africa, Asia, and Europe.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn15"" id=""ffn15"">[15]</a></sup> Offering biological evidence for racial differences is, under the current regime, “racist” by definition. This point was not lost on Lahn’s colleagues, whose personal attacks led Lahn to abandon the study of brain differences.</p>
<p>This sort of ostracism is by no means practiced only on the left. Kevin Lamb was summarily fired from his job as managing editor of the conservative newsweekly <em>Human Events</em> when it was discovered that, in his free time, he was writing for and editing <em>The Occidental Quarterly</em>, a journal “that specializes in research and analysis on issues involving race, ethnicity, politics and culture.” The journal in question has been denounced as “white supremacist” since it promotes the idea that Western Civilization is a product of the unique nature of European peoples.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn16"" id=""ffn16"">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jason Richwine was fired from his job as senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation in 2013. This occurred two days after the <em>Washington Post</em> reported that his Ph.D. dissertation argued that Hispanics have lower average intelligence than White Americans and questioned current immigration policy. The unseemly haste with which the Heritage Foundation acted, without even allowing Richwine to explain the context of his argument, underscores what is now obvious. A leading conservative think-tank ran to fire someone who questioned the orthodox leftist position on racial differences.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn17"" id=""ffn17"">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Well-known commentator and Contributing Editor at <em>National Review</em>, John Derbyshire was also fired in 2012 because of a satirical piece he published in the wake of the brouhaha over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin. The piece was a direct response to a highly publicized “talk” that required black mothers to warn their teenage sons about the dangers posed by White police. In his piece Derbyshire pointed to the hypocrisy of Blacks in their prejudicial view of White police, when contrasted with the real threat of Black crime. In his hypothetical talk with his children, he recited the dangers to Whites posed by black thugs. Instead of taking this for what it was, i.e., a serious rebuke to Black parents who instill fear of endemic White racism in their children, Derbyshire was summarily fired for unacceptable thoughts. Of course, the only people who should find this unacceptable are those who would deny the staggering reality of Black crime.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn18"" id=""ffn18"">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>In explaining the hostility to evolutionary thinking in liberal academic circles, Harvard evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker notes that findings of a genetic basis for racial differences would put into question “the assumption that all group-wide social differences (e.g., in crime, poverty, and health) are caused by discrimination or a rigged economic system. It would be an enormous challenge to the unspoken consensus of mainstream left-of-center politics during the past fifty years. . . .”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn19"" id=""ffn19"">[19]</a></sup> In a similar vein, Charles Murray, in a review of Nicolas Wade’s <em>A Troublesome Inheritance</em>, maintains that the book will not likely be welcome since it challenges the orthodox position that genes play no role in racial differences. Quoting Murray, “true believers in the orthodoxy still dominate the social science departments of the nation’s universities. I expect their resistance to “A Troublesome Inheritance” will be <em>fanatical</em>, because accepting its account will be seen, correctly, as a <em>cataclysmic surrender</em> on some of the core premises of political correctness.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn20"" id=""ffn20"">[20]</a></sup> It is obvious why the left would object to evolutionary theories of human behavior that explain national, racial, and class differences, since the rejection of the particularities of human beings have been a motivating force of the Left since the French Revolution. The Right has generally been comfortable with the idea that there is a natural hierarchy of talents among men, and a spectrum of diverse abilities and temperaments. From this perspective, nations reflect the particular nature of distinct historic peoples. For the Left, any national or local attachments are but a retrograde tribalism that undermines the ideal of a universal human solidarity. Certainly one of the most powerful conservative argument against communist regimes, and leftism in general, is that, in their attempt to abolish natural hierarchies and national loyalties, they crush the diversity and uniquenesses within the human species. After all, if one views <em>difference</em> as inherently unjust, how can one deny the need to abolish these inequities and eliminate physically or marginalize those who promote them. Leftism can be viewed, in this way, as a centuries-long revolt against human nature. </p>
<p>On a more mundane level, the reality of human differences is, as James Watson suggested, the most powerful argument against the varied wasteful and generally unpopular policies pursued in the name of “fighting inequality.” For instance, the government has continued to spend enormous sums in the attempt to eliminate racial disparities in educational attainment on the false premise that any such differences are the result of bias, rather than the result of obvious differences in ability. Fifty years of this effort have produced <em>no</em> reduction in racial differences in academic performance. Currently, major efforts are underway to expand the efforts of the Head Start program into universal pre-schooling, which all research has shown to be of no value in improving performance.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn21"" id=""ffn21"">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>A recognition of natural group differences would allow for a serious challenge to programs of racial preferences in the form of Affirmative Action, minority set-asides, and disparate impact rulings, all of which are premised on the assumption that racial differences in ability and temperament do not exist. An acknowledgment of fundamental differences between the sexes would allow for a principled stand against the disturbing policy of placing women in combat roles in the military and rules that require ignoring sexual differences in hiring decisions. Similarly, rules that require equal expenditures on high-school athletic programs for males and females only make sense if there are no sexual differences in athletic interests and abilities. The reader can add his own examples to the list of foolish rulings based on the absurd assumption that the only differences between boys and girls are secondary sexual characteristics. Disparate impact rulings that fail to acknowledge racial and sexual differences often undermine public safety. How could it be otherwise when the recognition of group differences are made illegal in the recruitment of policemen, firemen, soldiers and sailors?</p>
<p>Affirmative-action is profoundly contrary to the traditional American principles of individual autonomy and responsibility, and totally inconsistent with the bedrock American value of self-reliance. Such a policy is built on the hateful idea of group guilt, of visiting the sins of the father on the son. Even if one accepts the dubious assertion that Black difficulties are the result of slavery and Jim Crow, that hardly requires the remedy of handicapping individuals born generations later, whose ancestors, in almost all cases, had nothing to do with slavery or Jim Crow. On what basis, furthermore, can a claim be made that recent Asian and Hispanic immigrants are entitled to special consideration? Such a claim rests on the patently false assertion that most Whites cannot be trusted to treat people of different races fairly. </p>
<p>Differences in ability between groups have obvious social implications, but so too do differences in temperament. The refusal to accept the reality of such differences obfuscates the reasons for the great racial and sexual disparities in criminal conduct. For instance, recent research indicates that certain variants of the MAO gene are very much implicated in criminal behavior, and are much more common in some racial groups than in others.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn22"" id=""ffn22"">[22]</a></sup> Likewise, the huge disparities in violent criminal behavior between men and women are inexplicable, absent an understanding of important temperamental differences between the sexes. Denial of such differences hinders effective measures of crime control. For example, the proactive crime prevention “stop and frisk” policies of the New York City Police department necessarily leads to a racially disparate impact in the people questioned by police. That practice, which obviously must be partially based on racial and sexual profiling, is falsely claimed to be evidence of racial discrimination. Of course, nobody questions why more men than women are stopped and frisked by police. Why not? The answer, in the case of sexual differences is obvious, but so is the answer in the case of racial differences. Proactive policing in New York City dramatically reduced violent crime, but that seemed to be of no consequence in a judge’s decision, rightly set aside, that forbade the New York City police from continuing the use of this highly effective tactic. In other words, public safety had to be compromised on the dubious grounds that effective policing is racially motivated, no matter that most perpetrators of violent crime, and most of its victims, are members of racial minorities.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn23"" id=""ffn23"">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>An admission of important group differences would allow for a serious examination of an immigration policy, opposed by most Americans, based on the flawed multicultural notion that human beings are everywhere the same and can be moved about the world without serious, and often negative, consequences. For instance, the denial of differences between the human capital of North and Central Americans results in the unquestioned support for family unification in immigration policy and for continued support for birthright citizenship. The entirely foreseeable consequence of this denial has been the flooding of America with disproportionate numbers of Hispanic immigrants, who have educational and economic difficulties. </p>
<p>One would think that the left, which makes so much of rising income inequality, would be champions for curtailing mass immigration, which drives down wages and employment, especially for those with limited academic skills. Surely massive immigration is a major contributor to the wage stagnation afflicting American workers. The Left’s attachment to open borders is plain and clearly reflects the Left’s universalist multicultural ideology, but also reflects their venal desire for boosting the electoral prospects of the Democratic Party. Poorly educated Hispanic immigrants are ready-made recruits for the Democratic Party and represent a vast source of clientele for those employed at all levels in an ever-growing welfare state bureaucracy. Here, as in so many cases, the interests of labor and industry converge.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn24"" id=""ffn24"">[24]</a></sup> Those immigrants, many of whom serve as clients in the welfare state, are also an abundant source of labor, which, in depressing wages, bolsters the bottom line of industrial and farm enterprises. It is important to emphasize that it is not merely cheap manual labor that explains the eagerness of the United States Chamber of Commerce to expand immigration. The leaders of technology firms are among the most vociferous in claiming the need for increased immigration quotas (and H1B visas) for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) employees, on the false argument that such technically trained people cannot be found among Americans. But this is a chicken-and-egg problem of the industry’s making. The easy availability of less expensive foreign technology workers drives down wages and serves to discourage American students from pursuing difficult and expensive educations. How can they be expected to compete with foreigners for whom even low wages by American standards are much better than anything they could have gotten at home.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn25"" id=""ffn25"">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One of the most tragic consequences of the denial of human diversity has been the decline of cities and the access to urban amenities for people of modest means. Everyone is familiar with the depressing fact that large stretches of major American cities are dysfunctional, ugly, and dangerous places, barely tolerable by those who, for any number of reasons, are unable to leave. Not so well publicized, but obvious to the observant traveler, has been the havoc visited upon the urban enclaves of the American heartland. Just about every mid-size American city has seen its downtown hollowed out and its middle-class population relocated to the suburbs. The term <em>relocated</em> is not used arbitrarily, but is chosen to highlight the fact that this migration out of cities was not the result of some spontaneous impulse, but rather the direct result of government policies that made those cities uninviting and in many cases unlivable for middle-class individuals. What good is it to live in a place where your child can walk to school, if the school is all but useless academically, and if the walk to school is through neighborhoods that are both aesthetically disfigured and unsafe. From Richmond, Virginia, to Florence, South Carolina, in the south, to Buffalo, New York, and Camden, New Jersey in the north, the pattern is sad and undeniable. The heroic efforts of civic minded, usually older, individuals to revitalize their downtowns are often to no avail. Their children and grandchildren, who were carried to the suburbs, do not even know what has been lost. </p>
<p>Civil-rights advocates and bureaucrats who are unaware or ideologically blind to the reality of human differences are, under Section 8 guidelines and anti-discrimination edicts, requiring the relocation of dysfunctional minority families into the suburban enclaves to which many less-than-wealthy middle-class people retreated in an attempt to escape the depredations that beset many urban neighborhoods. This effort is being pursued under the false assumption that it is chaotic neighborhoods that create dysfunctional families. But research clearly shows that it is the other way around: Dysfunctional <em>people</em> are simply incapable of creating healthy communities.(ft: Hanna Rosen, American Murder Mystery, <em>The Atlantic</em>, July/August 2008.) Common decency requires a concern for, and need to assist, people who have difficulty in creating well-functioning communities. It is sheer folly, however, to imagine that seriously maladjusted people can be magically transformed by a ride down the road in a moving van. This is, of course, the same mentality that imagines that a native of Somalia can be metamorphosed into a blue-eyed Scandinavian by moving him to Minnesota. </p>
<p>It is not only the unfairness of Affirmative Action and other leveling policies that should be of concern to thoughtful people. More important is that these policies tend to obscure the far more serious problem of how to deal with the problems technological progress present for people with limited intellectual resources. In the past, such people could support themselves with menial jobs on farms and in factories, and in a host of semi-skilled trades. But these sorts of jobs are becoming increasingly rare. Lower and middle-class Americans with IQs below the White average are caught in the pincers of labor-saving technologies, off-shoring, outsourcing and the massive importation of labor. One result is a growing underclass described so clearly by Charles Murray in his book <em>Coming Apart</em>.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn26"" id=""ffn26"">[26]</a></sup> It has also led to a stagnation of wages for the middle-class and growing income inequality. A serious conservative movement would wish to confront this problem directly and attempt to find ways to deal with it. This is so because a concern for the problems of one’s less talented countrymen is rightly seen as a patriotic duty. The myth of equality serves to free elites from any real obligation to those who have been less lucky in life’s genetic lottery. In this view, people lacking marketable skills need only avail themselves of the unlimited educational opportunities that America provides. It is facilely asserted that people who used to assemble automobiles and television sets should be able to advance, through education, to more technical remunerative occupations. But this supposes that there will be many high-skilled jobs that can’t be outsourced or off-shored, and that almost all Americans have the capacity to be trained for such jobs. The first supposition is highly unlikely; the second is patently absurd. </p>
<p>A problem of enormous human difficulty for modern societies is thus confounded with what is a transient problem of race relations. The absurdities of Affirmative Action can only be defended by a denial of the unfairness of life’s lottery. Imagine anyone claiming that placing a short player on a professional basketball team would enable him to overcome his disadvantage in height. That is hardly different from claiming that a Black person’s academic weakness can be overcome by admission to an elite college. In both cases, the remedy is absurd because the premise is absurd. Playing basketball with superior players will not make the short man tall, nor will going to school with superior intellects make the dumb student smart. Placing people in positions on artificial grounds merely postpones the need to find practical means to address the base cause of differential performance, and find ways to help people with lesser ability lead self-sufficient and gratifying lives. This is a problem for all advanced societies and not one unique to mixed race societies.</p>
<p>A serious attempt to assist less-capable Americans would require addressing the sources of their difficulties, a primary source of which is American industry’s attachment to the doctrine of free trade, facilitated by the breakdown of national borders. This allows for the location of production to low-wage countries and increases corporate profits, the benefits of which accrue to investors and industrial managers. Free trade, therefore, requires American workers to compete with workers in countries with much lower standards of living, resulting in lower wages and reduced employment opportunities. This well-known phenomenon is treated as a natural and inevitable outcome of the laws of economics. Recently, however, respected economists, such as Ian Fletcher, have provided strong arguments that the theory of free trade is deeply flawed and some form of protection is necessary to keep industries in America, where they can provide decent salaries for American workers.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn27"" id=""ffn27"">[27]</a></sup> Ricardo’s principle of comparative advantage, upon which the doctrine of free trade is based, claims that every country’s prosperity can be maximized by doing what each does best. Fletcher argues that Ricardo’s theory was based on a set of highly restricted assumptions that are rarely satisfied today. Moreover, whatever the basis for a country’s prosperity, there is no assurance that all individuals within a prosperous country will prosper. In a global economy, just the opposite may be true; the world’s most talented will prosper, while others will fall by the wayside. It little matters to those unable to compete in a world market if they live in a prosperous country but are impoverished nonetheless. It is hard to deny that an American worker has a difficult time competing with workers who can live comfortably on one-half to one-tenth the wage a reasonable living would require in America. </p>
<p>It bears repeating that our open-borders policy exacerbates the problem by flooding the United States with low-skilled workers from Mexico and Central America, who compete directly with similarly skilled Americans. The same is true, as mentioned earlier, for middle-class Americans, who are squeezed by competition from talented immigrants from almost every continent in the world. The result, as Edwin Rubenstein has amply documented, is the erosion of wages and employment opportunities for native-born Americans.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn28"" id=""ffn28"">[28]</a></sup> The argument that a more populated America is a more prosperous America for all workers was true so long as American enterprise dominated the world and the American market was, in large measure, insulated from world competition; a rising GNP could almost guarantee a rising <em>per capita</em> GNP. A bigger pie provides bigger slices for everyone involved, but only so long as the population grows more slowly than the size of the pie. However, if the number of people wishing to sup grows, while the pie does not, many people must leave the table hungry, and economic activity comes to resemble a zero-sum competition. In recent years, the American share of world industry has been shrinking, but the number of people seeking employment in American industry is rising. </p>
<p>A primary responsibility of a nation’s leaders is to forward the interests of all citizens. A concern with the nation’s industrial competitiveness is certainly legitimate, but must be tempered by a moral imperative to provide opportunities for less talented individuals. No constitutional republic can remain healthy without a citizenship made up of of self-sufficient and self-respecting individuals. A citizenship that depends on government largess must inevitably descend into a debased democracy and finally into tyranny. Too often such concerns are dismissed by both the Left and the Right as relics of discredited theories of protectionism, and of xenophobia, racism, sexism and all the other bogymen of political correctness. </p>
<p>Most of the policies that frustrate significant majorities of Americans could be resolved by the simple admission that racial groups differ in important ways and that such differences are as fixed as are differences in physiognomy; they are simply not amenable to elimination by government edict. No amount of government intervention can possibly eliminate group disparities in educational, economic and social attainment. Any and all attempts to do so are not only fraught with dangers to a free society but are bound to fail. Denying this reality is to invite a heavy-handed totalitarianism that imposes a superficial and false equality at the cost of human freedom and well-being. The history of the 20th century bears undeniable evidence for this assertion: The leveling impulse, taken to its ultimate conclusion. has not produced human equality; instead it has destroyed society’s decency and the dignity of its people. </p>
<p>Given the unpopularity of so many multicultural and other left-wing policies it is difficult to understand why the conservative establishment is reluctant to challenge the bases of these policies. Why, for instance, have mainstream conservatives not endorsed the growing consensus that real and important differences exist between the races? Acknowledgement of these differences would allow for a principled stand against the left-wing drift in American social policy. Why not forcefully reject the doctrine of multiculturalism? That doctrine is not only ahistorical and utterly incompatible with conservative philosophy but corrosive of national unity. How are we to understand the refusal of conservatives to forthrightly argue for a natural diversity of abilities and temperaments and for the preservation of the historic American nation, rooted in European custom and ancestry? </p>
<p>Why does the Republican Party refuse to take such a principled position? One obvious reason is that those who object to the leftward drift in American society are overwhelmingly White and of European descent. Most Whites have little to gain, and much to lose, by the continuation of current trends. Most non-Whites, on the other hand, have no difficulty with leftist policies, since a considerable proportion benefit from them. There is no doubt that, should the Republican Party champion the interests of the majority White Americans, the dominant media would demonize the Republican Party and paint them as endorsing a divisive and ugly racist strategy. But it is foolish to worry over this since the Republican Party is <em>already</em> so characterized in the media. Indeed, the Democratic Party claims to represent the interests of all minorities and the other casualties of oppressive “White privilege” and have clearly defined themselves a vehicle for the aggrieved, whatever their class, race, or sex. How would it do Republicans any harm to accept the left’s characterization as the defenders of the historic (European) nation? It takes a curiously benighted vision to imagine that standing by the historic America is somehow “un-American”! Without belaboring an argument made so cogently by Steve Sailer, it only takes a modest majority of White Americans to win most elections.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn29"" id=""ffn29"">[29]</a></sup> The reason is simple; the overwhelming majority of the electorate is White and will be so for some decades to come. Minorities are, after all, in the minority, especially among those who are active participants in electoral politics. Pursuing a chimerical attempt to garner more minority votes by supporting policies opposed by most Republican core voters is, quite simply, self-defeating.</p>
<p>It is difficult not to conclude that those who carry the mantle of conservatism are, in fact, not conservative at all, but are closer to apolitical apparatchiks of what has become an oligarchic social order. They include members of a professional governing class that thrives so long as they forward the interests of those who pay the exorbitant bills for their reelection. They are the educators and media elites whose generous salaries and outsized prestige are preserved so long as they support the existing order that rests on the doctrines of multiculturalism and unfettered free trade. It is an order that richly rewards those who throw in their lot with multinational corporations or the ever widening reach of the bureaucratic state. Such people are an internationalist vanguard, as it were, heralding a new world order of supranational organizations such as the European Union. Theirs is a vision conditioned by the economic benefits of ever widening and interwoven markets, while ignoring the social and political disruptions such developments must necessarily entail. In such a vision, a North American Union composed of Canada, the United States and Mexico, in time joined by the nations of Central America and the Caribbean, has much to recommend it. That such a program would undermine the historic European heritage of the United States is of small consequence. How could it be otherwise for those who have worked so assiduously to render the United States a borderless nation, in fact, if not yet in law.</p>
<p>According to Francis Fukayama “postmodern elites . . . feel that they have evolved beyond identities defined by religion and nation and have arrived at a superior place.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn30"" id=""ffn30"">[30]</a></sup> British philosopher Roger Scruton observed that such thinking explains “the acceptance of subsidized immigration, and for attacks on customs and institutions associated with traditional and native forms of life.” A typical member of this elite, according to Scruton, “repudiates national loyalties and defines his goals and ideals <em>against</em> the nation. . . .” He sees himself “as a defender of enlightened universalism against local chauvinism.” It follows then that such a person defines “his political vision in terms of cosmopolitan values that have been purified of all reference to the particular attachments of a real historical community.” <sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn31"" id=""ffn31"">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Getting on today in the elite circles of academia, the media, politics, and corporate America requires allegiance to this deracinated vision and a disdain for the concerns of the benighted and recalcitrant Americans, who cleave to their bibles and their nation and their other assorted superstitions. This explains the vicious attacks on those who believe human differences are real and express reservations about the benefits of multiculturalism, unfettered immigration, and the internationalist agenda. Those that do so challenge the essential underpinnings for the privileges, both honorary and pecuniary, of statist bureaucrats and managerial elites and their enablers in academia and the media. </p>
<p>The dissolution of the historic American nation is well underway, and there is little on the horizon to give hope that it would be otherwise. One must remain in the dark as to what comes after, but perhaps it will be less bleak than reason, at present, dictates.<br/></p>

But is “immigration” an accurate term for this phenomenon?</p>
<p>Some critics of “immigration” feel the term is euphemistic and prefer to label the phenomenon “invasion.” Guillaume Faye calls it “colonization.” Yet, although the use of alternative terminology is motivated by legitimate concerns with the scale, the permanence, and the non-assimilation associated with modern immigration in the West, neither alternative seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>First, the scale of immigration does not alter the nature of the phenomenon, as the definition of “immigration” still holds so long as it describes individuals moving from one polity to another for purposes of establishing residence. Secondly, length of residence does not transform immigration into something else, as immigration does not exclude, and, indeed, often involves, permanent relocation. Thirdly, assimilation is separate from, and not a condition for, successful immigration, even if it is so for integration. Furthermore, both invaders and colonizers can be immigrants, but immigrants are not necessarily invaders or colonizers (and they are neither if they appeal to the established sovereignty for admission, inclusion, and integration.)</p>
<p>Indeed, “invasion” is wide of the mark. In a geopolitical sense, an invasion is an aggressive military operation aimed at “conquering, liberating, or re-establishing control or authority over a territory, forcing the partition of a country, altering the established government or gaining concessions from said government, or a combination thereof.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn1"" id=""ffn1"">1</a></sup> In a biological sense, the term still involves aggression. Modern “immigration” in the West, though it may have similar effects, and though some “immigrants” may be aggressive, is neither military in character nor centrally organized—save exceptionally and loosely—by either active or passive encouragement to emigrate and resettle in a specific polity or territory.</p>
<p>“Colonization” is much closer to the mark, but still not on it. The term refers to the establishment of colonies in one territory by people from another territory, but colonies can comprise colonists or colonials, the latter of which is linked to colonialism. In colonialism, a metropole claims sovereignty over the colony, deliberately changing—when the territory is already inhabited—the social structure, government, and economics of the colonized territory. “Immigration” is not “colonization” in this sense. Arguably, “immigrants” into the West have increasingly sought to gain or exert control over the social structure, government, and economics of their host countries, but they are not—save with one exception, mentioned below—subjects of a metropole with a deliberate policy of colonization. The “immigrants” issue from multiple metropoles, which are uncoordinated, geographically dispersed, may be rivals or enemies, and in all but one case operate no policy of colonization, officially or unofficially. Moreover, the so-called “immigrants” are not even coordinated among themselves, beyond temporary subjection by some or exploitation by criminal gangs of human traffickers.The “immigrants” are impelled, not by a single-minded desire to establish or join a colony, but by a variety of individual motives, mostly involving escape from danger or poverty in their native territory and a desire for safety and (above all) economic betterment in a prosperous metropole.</p>
<p>The term “colonization,” however, is not entirely inadequate, for modern “immigration” in the West still involves exogenous strangers colonizing Western polities. This is because, while different from colonialism, structurally the phenomenon remains related to it. A more apt term for the phenomenon of “immigration” would be “settler colonialism,” which can involve settlers from multiple metropoles whose behavior and consciousness is very similar to that of our modern Third World “immigrants”; but the term remains problematic, since it describes projects like Israel today, South Africa up until the early 20th century, and what eventually became the United States, from the 17th century through most of the 19th. Nevertheless, “settler colonialism” is structurally most similar to what is discussed in this essay, however, and provides a sound theoretical basis for what I propose to call, for the purposes of distinction, “settler colonization.”</p>
<p>In this essay, I will first provide a description of settler colonialism as it is currently theorized. I will then show how settler colonialism closely describes modern “immigration” in the West. Next, I will indicate how the Western experience with modern settlers from the Third World differs from that of past settler-colonial projects. Finally, I will suggest possible strategies for combating settler colonization in our hemisphere.</p>
<h2>Settler Colonialism</h2>
<p>Edward Cavanagh, editor of the <em>Settler Colonial Studies</em> journal, and Lorenzo Veracini, author of <em>Settler Colonialism: A Theoretical Overview</em>,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">[2]</a></sup> define settler colonialism as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Settler colonialism is a global and transnational phenomenon, and as much a thing of the past as a thing of the present. There is no such thing as neo-settler colonialism or post-settler colonialism because settler colonialism is a resilient formation that rarely ends. Not all migrants are settlers; as Patrick Wolfe has noted, settlers come to stay. They are founders of political orders who carry with them a distinct sovereign capacity. And settler colonialism is not colonialism: settlers want Indigenous people to vanish (but can make use of their labour before they are made to disappear). Sometimes settler colonial forms operate within colonial ones, sometimes they subvert them, sometimes they replace them. But even if colonialism and settler colonialism interpenetrate and overlap, they remain separate as they co-define each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his book, Veracini also ascribes to settler colonialism distinctive characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settler colonialism creates a dual division between itself, exogenous Others, and indigenous Others; these can be either virtuous or degraded.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism is always virtuous, always forward-moving, conceiving itself and its activity in terms of improvement and progress. Indigenous Others are rarely virtuous, but can be either elevated or degraded, while exogenous Others can be selectively included or segregated. However, settler colonialism more easily includes exogenous Others than indigenous Others and routinely fantasizes about exchanging indigenous Others with exogenous Others.</li>
<li>Inclusion and exclusion operate concomitantly, attraction and revulsion operate concurrently, without a need for consistency. Yet, while borders are internally porous, they are externally impermeable: settlers can go out, but indigenes cannot get in.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism involves the settler self undergoing coeval processes of indigenization and exogenization.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism thus converges with the original society, but the line is never crossed because the distinction needs to remain.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism dominates in order to transfer (remove); colonialism dominates in order to exploit.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism tends to underestimate the indigenous in various objective and subjective ways, making the indigenous invisible.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism, accordingly, subjectively conceives areas to be annexed or opened for settlement as vacant.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism sees itself as ultimately, if not immediately, autonomous, and therefore resists interference from the metropole; colonialism is subordinate to the metropole.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism is characterized by an exclusive interpretation of peoplehood, a specific understanding of sovereign capacities and their location, even though settlement itself is messy and most people move individually, “without a conscious determination to establish a new, ideal, society, and with no specific understanding of their own sovereignty.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Settler colonialism sees the settler colonial setting as charged with a special regenerative nature.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism is characterized by the ability to will a collective identity and its institutions into existence.</li>
<li>Settlers come to work and live in peace and see themselves as escaping from violence; a secure future in the new land is recurrently and dialectically opposed to an uncertain prospect in the old one.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism disavows its violent foundation, but peacefulness coexists with violence.</li>
<li>Settler colonialism suffers from “ongoing concerns with existential threats and a paranoid fear of ultimate decolonization.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn4"" id=""ffn4"">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Settler colonialism has a linear structure, whereas colonialism has a circular structure: for one, the literary metaphor is the <em>Aeneid</em>, for the other, the <em>Odyssey</em>; one involves non-discovery, since settlers simply reproduce their society; the other, discovery, since the discoverer reports back to the metropole; one involves <em>non-encounter</em> with the indigenous (they are invisible, shadows, undercounted, deterritorialized, sojourners, part of the landscape), the other <em>encounter</em> (through exploitation).</li>
<li>Settler colonialism, because it deterritorializes the indigenous and denies their state-forming capacity, can be superseded only by itself, ending with the complete elimination of the indigenous. In this case, the end is negotiated from within, including complicated and dubious processes of “national reconciliation.” The alternative ending is settler exodus or expulsion. In this case, there is never equality or any subsequent relationship between the indigenous and the settlers; settler colonialism is a winner-takes-all scenario: either the indigenous or the settlers disappear. Colonialism, on the other hand, ends with state formation (by the indigenous), and its end is a negotiation between states (the colonizers’ and the indigenous’).</li>
<li>Settler independence accelerates the process of nation-building and hence the process of erasure of the indigenous. Even well-meaning acts of reconciliation and incorporation entail the erasure of indigenous forms as it occurs in the context of settlers’ forms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Settler Colonialism In The West</h2>
<p>As has been noted, critics of “immigration” in the West have noted its unprecedented scale, its permanent character, and the non-assimilation/non-assimilability of Third World “immigrants.” Among the characteristics of settler colonialism is that settlers come to stay and do not appeal to the established indigenous sovereignty, but rather deny it and seek to remove it in order to replace it with a reproduction or regeneration of their own society. Implied in settler colonialism is scale: settlers may arrive as individual immigrants, but the process of reproduction, removal, and replacement necessitates sufficient scale successfully to neutralise, overcome, and eliminate indigenous resistance.</p>
<p>In Western Europe this is most apparent in the continuing growth of Islamic formations by immigrant Muslims, who, now numbering in the millions, found and daily operate their own structures in parallel with the indigenous authority. Spread across the regions, but concentrated in metropolitan enclaves, these structures may be physical, such as mosques and madrassas, or they may be legal-theological, such as arbitration tribunals based on Shariah law. Their prosperity benefits from demographic contraction and loss of faith by Europeans, whose churches are gradually converted into mosques; but it is also driven by a will to conquer the land, which, from time to time, find open expression across a range of settings, from the streets to high political office held by Muslims. During the disturbances caused by the publication of a cartoon of the prophet Mohammed in Denmark in 2005, Muslim protesters variously called for Shariah law for the United Kingdom, worldwide domination by Islam, the death or slaughter of those who insult Islam, and the extermination of Europeans. Similarly, in 2008, Labour politician Shahid Malik, former Justice Minister and Minister for Race, Faith and Community Cohesion at the Department for Communities and Local Government, stated at that year’s “Global Peace and Unity” conference, held at the Excel London Centre:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am proud of the achievements of Muslims in this country from ’97. In 19 97 we got our first Muslim MP. In 2001 we had two Muslim MPs. In 20 05 we had four Muslim MPs. In ša Allah, in 20 09-10, we’ll have eight Muslim MPs. In 2014 we’ll have sixteen Muslim MPs. At this rate, the whole Parliament will be Muslim! But just to say, in case there are journalists here today, that is not my objective. But you know, we’ ve got four Muslim MPs; there should be twenty Muslim MPs in Parliament. And in ša Allah very shortly we’ll see that. I am confident, as Britain’s first Muslim Minister, that, in ša Allah, in the next thirty years or so, we’ll see a Prime Minister in this country, who happens to share my faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such messages cannot be dismissed as simple expressions of anger or hopeful prognostication. Anger and hope can be expressed in many ways, and it is significant that, rather than calling for respect and toleration of a Muslim minority, the thrust of the messages, be it from protestors or from a Justice Minister, flowed uniformly in the direction of conquest, replacement, and Islamic supremacy.</p>
<p>In the United States, Mexican immigrants of recent decades have a well-documented history of forming their own parallel structures. In their case, it takes the form of businesses, pressure groups, student organizations, printed and electronic media, gangs, and social networks permeating occupations, neighborhoods, and local politics, within which all transactions and interactions are conducted in Spanish. Mexican immigrants, their descendants (including naturalized ones), as well as Mexicans in Mexico, also conceive themselves, even at official government level, as possessing a sovereign capacity as Mexicans—“I have said that Mexico does not stop at its border, that wherever there is a Mexican, there is Mexico.” A true Mexican immigrant leaves Mexico behind and appeals to the United States government so that he may eventually become an American; a Mexican <em>settler</em> takes Mexico with him, and, though he may take up American citizenship, the latter is done for purely instrumental (<em>e.g.</em>, economic) reasons. Some more ideologically racialist Mexicans dream of replacing the United States government with a Chicano superstate to be called “Aztlan.” A more common assumption of Mexican settlers is that part or all of the U.S. will gradually transform into a more lucrative version of their home country.</p>
<p>The process of replacement is made partially invisible by its interaction with a vestigial European settler colonial consciousness: “immigrants” have slowly built their structures largely in the shadows, persistently undercounted and underestimated. This is an instance where settler colonialism and settler colonization interpenetrate.</p>
<p>Third World settlers in the West replicate the dual division of peoples in settler colonial projects, and the relationship between self and other is analogous. Upon arrival, they are faced with indigenous Others, who comprise the majority and are ostensibly the established authority, as well as with exogenous Others, who comprise minorities of fellow travelers and against whom they are now pitted in competition for resources and admission by the established authority. When faced with real or perceived resistance by the indigenous, settlers perceive themselves in a shared predicament with exogenous Others. This makes them more receptive to establishing friendships or alliances with exogenous Others against the indigenous established authority. Said exogenous Others, however, may be found within structures of the established authority itself. Thus, generic pro-“immigrant” pressure groups emerge with the backing of establishment politicians. (As discussed further below, these politicians, though exogenous, may also be or appear to be indigenous.)</p>
<p>The consciousness of settler colonization in the West is always virtuous: settlers seek employment, economic betterment, educational improvement, professional progress, and a peaceful life. Indigenous Others are rarely virtuous: they are racists, bigots, Islamophobes, infidels, faithless, and degenerate. They can, however, be elevated by converting to the settler’s faith and/or cause. They can, by adopting their manners and sensibilities, also be selectively admitted into the settler collective, including through marriage, although this may require conversion. In the latter case, reluctant admission and desire for admission interpenetrate, for the settler, still perceiving himself as less powerful than the indigenous (even if more virtuous), sees acceptance as a gateway for deeper colonization and altering the indigenous society in ways more amenable to his collective (<em>e.g.</em> by campaigning for “anti-racist” legislation). When settlers run for political office, one part of them desires acceptance by the establishment (it is powerful and confers privilege), another desires to change that establishment (it is racist and excludes settlers). It is not gaining admission with a view to assimilating to the indigenous Other, but rather gaining admission with a view to neutralise and/or displace him.</p>
<p>Thus, inclusion by and of the settler and exclusion of the indigenous operate concomitantly, attraction and revulsion operating concurrently and without consistency.</p>
<p>The search for admission, even if without a view to assimilation, does involve a process of indigenization. The indigenous in Europe, because they tend towards individualism and low ethnocentricity, confuse indigenization of the settler with assimilation, not realizing that settlers are ethnocentric collectivists and seek eventually to recast European society in their image. The process of indigenization involves settlers becoming the indigenous, not settlers becoming <em>like</em> the indigenous (even though the former does superficially involve and necessitate the latter to varying degrees.)</p>
<p>A process of exogenization of the settler in relation to the latter’s original society is the other facet of his indigenization in Europe, for as he indigenizes in an alien environment, he also diverges from the members of his race, whom he has left behind. The evolution of past settler colonial projects, particularly those involving multiple races and ethnicities, such as what became the United States, point to the eventual emergence of a sense of peoplehood, albeit qualified by racial or ethnic membership. This means that while the United Kingdom may variously converge with India, Pakistan, Africa, and the Caribbean, settlers from these countries or regions, and more so their descendants, and particularly where they are racially mixed, will not see themselves as subjects or indigenous to those countries and regions, but as British citizens indigenous to Britain, whose heritage goes back to one or more of those countries or regions. It follows from this that while there will be convergence, the line will never be crossed because the distinction will always remain.</p>
<p>While the end result is the transference (removal) of the indigenous, settler colonization in the West coexists with exploitative relationships proper of straight colonialism. It is well known that Third World settlers in the West, even at the appellant stage, take advantage of the indigenous’ welfare state and concessionary provisions, and that these benefits are often a reason for immigrating in the first place; indeed, on the whole, these settlers consume more than they produce. However, exploitation is not limited to scrounging from the indigenous government: it also takes the form of various forms of ethnically organized fraud, such as car crash insurance claim scams, which are run by Muslim gangs, or ethnically organized exploitation, such as pedophilia, also associated with Muslim gangs. So long as the indigenous remain in charge, they remain both an obstacle and a resource.</p>
<p>This is linked both to the subjective underestimation of the indigenous and the conception of Europe as vacant. Although the latter may seem an exaggeration, it is not if we understand ethnocentricity as involving a certain “vacating” (or evacuation) of the Other’s humanity. Third World settlers in the West are by nature highly ethnocentric, at least in relation to the indigenous White majority. The West is thus conceived by settlers primarily as a space, a land, where there are resources and opportunity, not as comprising people just like them who can provide generosity and friendship. The indigenous Westerner, therefore, is vacant, present but absent, a somewhat abstract entity that has to be dealt with, if only because “it” holds the “keys to the kingdom,” but which is otherwise denied and subjectively disappears until the next time “it” gets in the way or the settler realizes he needs something from “it.” The indigenous White majority is essentially part of the landscape, but, as with irredentist Mexican settlers in the United States, it can be seen as sojourners, interlopers, or usurpers.</p>
<p>Both the emergent sense of peoplehood, even if multifarious and complicated by racial and ethnic divides and miscegenation, and the conception of a vacant land of opportunity, are concurrent with autonomy from the originating metropole, and even resistance to its interference. It must be borne in mind that many settlers immigrate as economic or political refugees, and seek to make a new life in the Western <em>El Dorado</em>. Making a new life is another way of saying regeneration; the West, and immigration to the West, are imbued with a regenerative nature. In turn, this regeneration occurs as a dual process, whereby the settler regenerates (that is, generates again) his own society and simultaneously has his life regenerated in (and/or by) the land of opportunity. Given the often dysfunctional nature of Third World societies, this duality would seem to be mutually negating, since the society being regenerated is the society from which the settler fled, and a successful regeneration of that society would impede the successful regeneration of the settler’s life. Indeed, a secure future in the new land is recurrently and dialectically opposed to an uncertain prospect in the old one. But settlers do not require consistency.</p>
<p>Third World settlers immigrating into the West are motivated primarily by the prospect of economic betterment; they have no specific understanding of their sovereignty and neither do they, with the exception of politicized Mexican settlers in the United States, possess a conscious collective will, for settlers move individually, even if they arrive in groups. All the same, as we have seen from the proliferation of parallel substitutive formations by settlers in the West, they do possess the ability to will a collective identity and its institutions into existence.</p>
<p>The process of doing so is non-violent, following a legal sequence comprising: appeal to the indigenous authority (for recognition and admission as permanent minorities, and eventually citizens); development of exogenous structures (serving as substitutes to indigenous ones); co-option of indigenous structures (lobbying for concessions, multiculturalism); subversion from without (lobbying for anti-racist legislation); and indigenization (becoming legislators, subversion from within). At the same time, the process coexists with violence, whereby the indigenous are physically attacked or subject to predations (typically muggings, robberies, racially motivated beatings, and rape), or else morally attacked (typically accusations of prejudice and “racism,” and/or “racism” hoaxes).</p>
<p>Conversely, settlers live in paranoid fear. In the West, colored settlers imagine themselves in the midst of indigenous “racists,” in an institutionally “racist” society, even though said society has invited them, granted them recognition, made concessions, opened its labour market to them, accepted them as citizens, elected them into public offices, denounced “racism” in all its forms, swiftly purged “racists” upon detection, and even changed its laws to criminalise “racism” and punish “racists” with added rigor. This may be because settlers both have a well-developed sense of racial identity, because they would never welcome colonization in their traditional homeland, and because they are routinely agitated by ideologically egalitarian fanatics. No matter what gains they make, the fear of “racism” is ever present, and the perceived risk of expulsion (decolonization) ever lingering. In both Europe and the United States, it has happened before: in 1492 (the Spanish <em>Reconquista</em>) and 1954 (Operation Wetback).</p>
<p>Expulsion or a mass exodus would, indeed, be the only way to end Third World settler colonization in the West. Millions of settlers are citizens, many going back several generations, not a few descended from mixed race marriages. Short of expulsion or a mass exodus, the long-term effect of settler colonization, aided by high numbers of incomers and differential fertility favouring the settlers, is the replacement of the indigenous population. The latter will not need to disappear entirely, at least as a biological entity, before being completely dispossessed: even without violence, the indigenous institutions of democracy and equality provide the logic and mechanisms for dispossession. If the majority of people in Britain are Muslim, for example, democracy necessitates that they be proportionally represented in the seats of political, economic, cultural, academic, and institutional power. The historical rarity and fugaciousness of democracy in the Third World, however, suggests that democratic governance would end as soon as it ceases to be useful for the settlers, though this is not to say that the indigenous could not well dispense with it in the face of an immediate existential threat—democracy has proven historically rare and fugacious in the West, too.</p>
<p>Without the complete erasure of the indigenous Westerners, the end of Third World settler colonization in the West would at best imply a dubious procedure of “national reconciliation,” involving negotiation by the indigenous with triumphant settlers from within, and in the context of settlers’ established forms. Most likely, given the multiracial character of settler colonization in the West, is that one ethnicity would gain the ascendancy over all the others, and it would be they who become the new indigenous. The Bantus in South Africa provide a historical example.</p>
<h2>Uniqueness of Settler Colonization in the West</h2>
<p>Settler colonization in the West is not unique because of its scale or the fact that settlers are poor. Settler colonialist projects have involved large numbers in the past and many of the settlers have been poor—in most cases, they immigrated looking for a better life. The uniqueness of our experience with settler colonization results from the unique features of modern Western societies.</p>
<p>First, it is the colonization of the more powerful by the less powerful, of the former colonialists by the formerly colonized; it is, in other words, a reversion of past colonialism and settler colonialism.</p>
<p>Secondly, this process enjoys the ongoing complicity of the indigenous’ ruling elites, who, wittingly or unwittingly, instigated it in the first place out of a perceived economic need, and have since institutionalized it out of political opportunism, greed, a sense of historical guilt, or befuddlement with an ideology of human universalism. The opening of land to colonists by leaders is not unique: African kings in southern Africa either sold or gave away land to European settlers in exchange for military service during the 19th century. What is unique is the institutionalization of a policy of welcoming settler colonization, supported by a universalist ideology that makes the voluntary transfer of land and sovereignty morally virtuous.</p>
<p>Thirdly, alongside indigenous collaborationism, Third World settler colonization in the West has been catalyzed by both historical events and the existence of a hostile or at least self-serving exogenous minority of very able intellectuals, businessmen, and legislators. The excesses of the National Socialist government in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s, Allied victory in World War II, and the moral capital amassed and exploited by Jews—and especially radical Marxist Jews—as a result of well publicized National Socialist persecution, permitted the development of Jewish intellectual movements that subjected traditional European identity and institutions to radical critiques. Their effect was the gradual deprecation of European tradition and racial identity and the development of universalism to its logical extreme. Interacting with guilt as the primary method of social control in the West, this made it possible even for genetically distant immigrants eventually to become legislators because it had become impossible for the indigenous to argue against exclusion based on race.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn5"" id=""ffn5"">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Fourthly, the sovereignty transfers take a more abstract form than the land leases, cessions, seizure, or annexations that have characterized settler colonialist projects elsewhere. In the West transfers occur at the legal, policy, and moral- philosophical levels; they involve, for example, changes in legislation that privilege settlers over the indigenous, abdication of indigenous racial consciousness as a morally legitimate cognitive structure, or discrimination policies against the indigenous designed disproportionately to enhance settlers’ access to higher education and the job market. Similarly, the emptiness and evacuation of the “land of opportunity” among settlers occurs at a much more abstract level than allowed by indigenous demographic contraction: the Western “land of opportunity” is densely populated and highly developed, so the evacuation is purely subjective. Its closest analogue is modern Israel, where the “promised land” is subjectively emptied by denying Palestinians the same moral and symbolic status as Jews.</p>
<p>Finally, the settler colonization in the West does not involve the ignoring or direct overrunning of the indigenous, but rather an incremental engagement, which runs concomitantly with a process of gradual transformation of the settler from appellant to citizen to legislator, which is, in turn, wrapped up with the process of indigenization already mentioned.</p>
<p>Third World settler colonization of the West is possible only as a result of a uniquely Western ideology (egalitarianism) and an autochthonous political system (democracy), both of which morally and ideologically disarm the indigenous against settler ascendancy and predation.</p>
<h2>Ending Settler Colonization</h2>
<p>As has been noted, settler colonialism rarely ends, and it is superseded only by itself. After the United States’ independence, the former settlers ceased to be colonials from a distant mother country because their mother country had become the United States. Moreover, the indigenous were in time either displaced or made to disappear entirely, so there was no question of the indigenous regaining their independence and the colonials returning home—as just stated, the latter were at home. Third World settler colonization in the West being analogous, it follows that the crisis faced by Westerners is much more fundamental than simple out-of-control immigration. A polity can exclude immigrants and strip resident immigrants of their citizenship, but settlers are founders of polities, so they cannot be stripped of their own citizenship by the displaced indigenes, since the indigenous sovereignty is not recognized.</p>
<p>It should be apparent that we in the West live still in a time of transition, where immigration coexists with and interpenetrates settler colonization, and where one has not entirely given way to the other. Yet it is already possible for a citizen of South Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent in the United Kingdom to treat, for example, a White South African over the age of 16 immigrating into the island as a foreigner, and to be in a position to grant or deny admittance, even where the South African has blood ties to the island going back thousands of years and was born to United Kingdom citizens. Conversely, it is no longer possible, without an abrogation of modern Westernism’s basic philosophical tenets, suddenly to withdraw citizenship from a United Kingdom resident descended from one or more generations of South Asian or Afro-Caribbean citizens. Even the overnight expulsion of illegal immigrants and the passing of the most restrictive immigration law imaginable in our present ideological context could not deal with this problem. As time passes, the immigration reform debate will become increasingly irrelevant.</p>
<p>Where settler colonialism was terminated or reversed, such as in South Africa after Nelson Mandela, Rhodesia after Robert Mugabe, and Haïti after Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the measures required were violent and broke (or would have broken had it existed) current international law. Because this law is premised on equality as an absolute moral good, reversing settler colonization in the West would, without first abrogating this law, or else discrediting the moral basis for such body of law, also imply violent and illegal acts. Settler colonization is, after all, a game of erasure: settlers erase or are erased; no ongoing or equitable relationship is possible between settlers and indigenes. And the single biggest impediment to Whites’ avoiding erasure is the hegemonic belief in the West in <em>equality</em> as an absolute moral good, because the latter dictates that settlers be accorded equal rights and privileges to the indigenous (despite settlers being hostile), and because this belief effectively short-circuits the possibility of an opposing belief in the morality of White racial consciousness and preservation.</p>
<p>Whites in Europe and North America, as well as in former colonies in Africa, the South Pacific, and South America, currently lack a moral theory, let alone the legal means (since the latter would stem from the former), with which to justify and secure their continuity. Unless a new moral theory of <em>difference</em> can be formulated to support an ideology and legal framework that both justifies and enables its self-preservation as a unique biological entity in their own homelands, the White race faces complete erasure from the Earth.</p>

Our country is also committed―legally and morally―to the view that race is not a fit criterion for decision-making of any kind, except for promoting “diversity” or for the purpose of redressing past wrongs done by Whites to non-Whites. </p>
<p>Many Americans cite the “all men are created equal” phrase from the Declaration of Independence to support the claim that this view of race was not only inevitable but was anticipated by the Founders. Interestingly, prominent conservatives and Tea Party favorites like Michele Bachman and Glenn Beck have taken this notion a step further and asserted that today’s racial egalitarianism was the nation’s goal from its very first days.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:1"" id=""fnref:1"" title=""see footnote"">[1]</a> </p>
<p>They are badly mistaken.</p>
<p>Since early colonial times, and until just a few decades ago, virtually all Whites believed race was a fundamental aspect of individual and group identity. They believed people of different races had different temperaments and abilities, and built markedly different societies. They believed that only people of European stock could maintain a society in which they would wish to live, and they strongly opposed miscegenation. For more than 300 years, therefore, American policy reflected a consensus on race that was the very opposite of what prevails today. </p>
<p>Those who would impute egalitarianism to the Founders should recall that in 1776, the year of the Declaration, race slavery was already more than 150 years old in North America and was practiced throughout the New World, from Canada to Chile.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:2"" id=""fnref:2"" title=""see footnote"">[2]</a> In 1770, 40 percent of White households in Manhattan owned Black slaves, and there were more slaves in the colony of New York than in Georgia.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:3"" id=""fnref:3"" title=""see footnote"">[3]</a> It was true that many of the Founders considered slavery a terrible injustice and hoped to abolish it, but they meant to expel the freed slaves from the United States, not to live with them in equality.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson’s views were typical of his generation. Despite what he wrote in the Declaration, he did not think Blacks were equal to Whites, noting that “in general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:4"" id=""fnref:4"" title=""see footnote"">[4]</a> He hoped slavery would be abolished some day, but “when freed, he [the Negro] is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:5"" id=""fnref:5"" title=""see footnote"">[5]</a> Jefferson also expected whites eventually to displace all of the Indians of the New World. The United States, he wrote, was to be “the nest from which all America, North and South, is to be peopled,”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:6"" id=""fnref:6"" title=""see footnote"">[6]</a> and the hemisphere was to be entirely European: “… nor can we contemplate with satisfaction either blot or mixture on that surface.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:7"" id=""fnref:7"" title=""see footnote"">[7]</a></p>
<p>Jefferson opposed miscegenation for a number of reasons, but one was his preference for the physical traits of Whites. He wrote of their “flowing hair” and their “more elegant symmetry of form,” but emphasized the importance of color itself<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:8"" id=""fnref:8"" title=""see footnote"">[8]</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are not the fine mixtures of red and white, the expressions of every passion by greater or less suffusions of colour in the one [whites], preferable to that eternal monotony, which reigns in the countenances, that immovable veil of black, which covers all the emotions of the other race?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like George Washington, Jefferson was a slave owner. In fact, nine of the first 11 Presidents owned slaves, the only exceptions being the two Adamses. Despite Jefferson’s hope for eventual abolition, he made no provision to free his slaves after his death.</p>
<p>James Madison agreed with Jefferson that the only solution to the race problem was to free the slaves and expel them: “To be consistent with existing and probably unalterable prejudices in the U.S. freed blacks ought to be permanently removed beyond the region occupied by or allotted to a White population.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:9"" id=""fnref:9"" title=""see footnote"">[9]</a> He proposed that the federal government buy up the entire slave population and transport it overseas. After two terms in office, he served as chief executive of the American Colonization Society, which was established to repatriate Blacks.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:10"" id=""fnref:10"" title=""see footnote"">[10]</a> </p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin wrote little about race, but had a sense of racial loyalty that was typical of his time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably [sic] very small… . I could wish their Numbers were increased…. But perhaps I am partial to the Complexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Franklin therefore opposed bringing more Blacks to the United States<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:11"" id=""fnref:11"" title=""see footnote"">[11]</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hy increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America?""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Dickinson was a Delaware delegate to the constitutional convention and wrote so effectively in favor of independence that he is known as the “Penman of the Revolution.” As was common in his time, he believed that homogeneity, not diversity, was the new republic’s greatest strength<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:12"" id=""fnref:12"" title=""see footnote"">[12]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where was there ever a confederacy of republics united as these states are…or, in which the people were so drawn together by religion, blood, language, manners, and customs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dickinson’s views were echoed in the second of <em>The Federalist Papers</em>, in which John Jay gave thanks that “Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people,”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:13"" id=""fnref:13"" title=""see footnote"">[13]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Constitution was ratified in 1788, Americans had to decide who they would allow to become part of their new country. The very first citizenship law, passed in 1790, specified that only “free white persons” could be naturalized,<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:14"" id=""fnref:14"" title=""see footnote"">[14]</a> and immigration laws designed to keep the country overwhelmingly white were repealed only in 1965. </p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton was suspicious even of European immigrants, writing that “the influx of foreigners must, therefore, tend to produce a heterogeneous compound; to change and corrupt the national spirit; to complicate and confound public opinion; to introduce foreign propensities.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:15"" id=""fnref:15"" title=""see footnote"">[15]</a> John Quincy Adams explained to a German nobleman that if Europeans were to immigrate, “they must cast off the European skin, never to resume it.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:16"" id=""fnref:16"" title=""see footnote"">[16]</a> Neither man would have countenanced immigration of non-Whites. </p>
<p>Blacks, even if free, could not be citizens of the United States until ratification of the 14th Amendment in 1868. The question of their citizenship arose during the Missouri crisis of 1820 to 1821. The Missouri constitution barred the immigration of Blacks, and some northern critics said that to prevent Blacks who were citizens of other states from moving to Missouri deprived them of protection under the privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution. The author of that clause, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina, was still alive, and denied that he, or any other Framer, intended the clause to apply to Blacks: “I perfectly knew that there did not then exist such a thing in the Union as a black or colored citizen, nor could I then have conceived it possible such a thing could have ever existed in it.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:17"" id=""fnref:17"" title=""see footnote"">[17]</a> </p>
<h3>THE ABOLITION MOVEMENT</h3>
<p>Today, it is common to think of the antebellum North as united in the desire to free the slaves and to establish them as the social and political equals of Whites. Again, this is a distorted view. First of all, slavery persisted in the North well into the post-Revolutionary period. It was not abolished in New York State until 1827, and it continued in Connecticut until 1848.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:18"" id=""fnref:18"" title=""see footnote"">[18]</a></p>
<p>Nor was abolitionist sentiment anything close to universal. Many Northerners opposed abolition because they feared it would lead to race mixing. The easiest way to stir up opposition to Northern abolitionists was to claim that what they were really promoting was intermarriage. Many abolitionists expressed strong disapproval of miscegenation, but the fact that speakers at abolitionist meetings addressed racially mixed audiences was sufficiently shocking to make any charge believable. There were no fewer than 165 anti-abolition riots in the North during the 1820s alone, almost all of them prompted by the fear that abolition would lead to intermarriage.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:19"" id=""fnref:19"" title=""see footnote"">[19]</a></p>
<p>The 1830s saw further violence. On July 4, 1834, the American Anti-Slavery Society read its Declaration of Sentiments to a mixed-race audience in New York City. Rioters then broke up the meeting and went on a rampage that lasted 11 days. The National Guard managed to bring peace only after the society issued a “Disclaimer,” the first point of which was: “We entirely disclaim any desire to promote or encourage intermarriages between white and colored persons.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:20"" id=""fnref:20"" title=""see footnote"">[20]</a></p>
<p>Philadelphia suffered a serious riot in 1838 after abolitionists, who had had trouble renting space to hold their meetings, built their own building. On May 17, the last day of a three-day dedication ceremony, several thousand people—many of high social standing—gathered at the hall and burned it down while the fire department stood by and did nothing.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:21"" id=""fnref:21"" title=""see footnote"">[21]</a></p>
<p>Sentiment against Blacks was so strong that many Northern Whites supported abolition only if it was linked, as Jefferson and Madison had proposed, to plans to deport or “colonize” Blacks. Most abolitionist activism therefore reflected a deep conviction that slavery was wrong, but not a desire to establish Blacks as social and political equals. William Lloyd Garrison and Angelina and Sarah Grimké favored equal treatment for Blacks in all respects, but theirs was very much a minority view. Henry Ward Beecher, brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe who wrote <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, expressed the majority view: “Do your duty first to the colored people here; educate them, Christianize them, and <em>then</em> colonize them.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:22"" id=""fnref:22"" title=""see footnote"">[22]</a> </p>
<p>The American Colonization Society was only the best known of many organizations founded for the purpose of removing Blacks from North America. At its inaugural meeting in 1816, Henry Clay described its purpose: to “rid our country of a useless and pernicious, if not dangerous portion of the population.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:23"" id=""fnref:23"" title=""see footnote"">[23]</a> The following prominent Americans were not just members but served as <em>officers</em> of the society: James Madison, Andrew Jackson, Daniel Webster, Stephen Douglas, William Seward, Francis Scott Key, Winfield Scott, John Marshall, and Roger Taney.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:24"" id=""fnref:24"" title=""see footnote"">[24]</a> James Monroe, another President who owned slaves, worked so tirelessly in the cause of “colonization” that the capital of Liberia is named Monrovia in recognition of his efforts.</p>
<p>Early Americans wrote their opposition to miscegenation into law. Between 1661 and 1725, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and all the southern colonies passed laws prohibiting inter-racial marriage and, in some cases, fornication.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:25"" id=""fnref:25"" title=""see footnote"">[25]</a> Of the 50 states, no fewer than 44 had laws prohibiting inter-racial marriage at some point in their past.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:26"" id=""fnref:26"" title=""see footnote"">[26]</a> Many Northern Whites were horrified to discover that some Southern slave owners had Black concubines. When Bostonian Josiah Quincy wrote an account of his 1773 tour of South Carolina, he professed himself shocked to learn that a “gentleman” could have relations with a “negro or mulatto woman.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:27"" id=""fnref:27"" title=""see footnote"">[27]</a></p>
<p>Massachusetts prohibited miscegenation from 1705 to 1843, but repealed the ban only because most people thought it was unnecessary.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:28"" id=""fnref:28"" title=""see footnote"">[28]</a> The new law noted that inter-racial relations were “evidence of vicious feeling, bad taste, and personal degradation,” so were unlikely to be so common as to become a problem.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:29"" id=""fnref:29"" title=""see footnote"">[29]</a> </p>
<p>The northern “free-soil” movement of the 1840s is often described as friendly to Blacks because it opposed the expansion of slavery into newly acquired territories. This is yet another misunderstanding. Pennsylvania Democrat David Wilmot started the movement when he introduced an amendment banning slavery from any territories acquired after the Mexican-American War. The “Wilmot Proviso” was certainly anti-slavery, but Wilmot was not an abolitionist. He did not object to slavery in the South; only to its spread into the Western territories. During the congressional debate, Wilmot asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whether that vast country, between the Rio Grande and the Pacific, shall be given up to the servile labor of the black, or be preserved for the free labor of the white man? … The negro race already occupy enough of this fair continent; let us keep what remains for ourselves, and for our children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wilmot called his amendment the “white man’s proviso.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:30"" id=""fnref:30"" title=""see footnote"">[30]</a> </p>
<p>The history of the franchise reflects a clear conception of the United States as a nation ruled by and for Whites. Every state that entered the Union between 1819 and the Civil War denied Blacks the vote. In 1855, Blacks could vote only in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Rhode Island, which together accounted for only four percent of the nation’s Black population. The federal government prohibited free Blacks from voting in the territories it controlled.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:31"" id=""fnref:31"" title=""see footnote"">[31]</a> </p>
<p>Several states that were established before the Civil War hoped to avoid race problems by remaining all White. The people of the Oregon Territory, for example, voted not to permit slavery, but voted in even greater numbers not to permit Blacks in the state at all. In language that survived until 2002, Oregon’s 1857 constitution provided that “[n]o free negro, or mulatto, not residing in this state at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall come, reside, or be within this State, or hold any real estate.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:32"" id=""fnref:32"" title=""see footnote"">[32]</a> </p>
<p>Despite Charles Pinckney’s confirmation in 1821 that no Black could be an American citizen, the question was taken up in the famous <em>Dred Scott</em> decision of 1857. The seven-to-two decision held that although they could be citizens of states, Blacks were not citizens of the United States and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court. Roger Taney, the chief justice who wrote the majority decision, noted that slavery arose out of an ancient American conviction about Negroes<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:33"" id=""fnref:33"" title=""see footnote"">[33]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.
 
Abraham Lincoln’s time was well beyond the era of the Founders, but many Americans believe it was “the Great Emancipator” who finally brought the egalitarian vision of Jefferson’s generation to fruition. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, they are mistaken. </p>
<p>Lincoln considered Blacks to be—in his words—“a troublesome presence”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:34"" id=""fnref:34"" title=""see footnote"">[34]</a> in the United States. During the Lincoln-Douglas debates he stated<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:35"" id=""fnref:35"" title=""see footnote"">[35]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His opponent Stephen Douglas was even more outspoken (in what follows, audience responses are recorded by the <em>Chicago Daily Times</em>, a Democratic paper):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For one, I am opposed to negro citizenship in any form. [Cheers—<em>Times</em>] I believe that this government was made on the white basis. [‘Good,’—<em>Times</em>] I believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever, and I am in favor of confining the citizenship to white men—men of European birth and European descent, instead of conferring it upon negroes and Indians, and other inferior races. [‘Good for you. Douglas forever,’—<em>Times</em>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Douglas, who was the more firmly anti-Black of the two candidates, won the election.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:36"" id=""fnref:36"" title=""see footnote"">[36]</a> </p>
<p>Lincoln opposed the expansion of slavery outside the South, but was not an abolitionist. He made war on the Confederacy only to preserve the Union, and would have accepted Southern slavery in perpetuity if that would have kept the South from seceding, as he stated explicitly.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:37"" id=""fnref:37"" title=""see footnote"">[37]</a></p>
<p>Indeed, Lincoln supported what is known as the Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, passed by Congress shortly before he took office, which forbade any attempt by Congress to amend the Constitution to give itself the power to “abolish or interfere” with slavery. The amendment therefore recognized that the federal government had no power over slavery where it already existed, and the amendment would have barred any future amendment to give the government that power. Outgoing President James Buchanan took the unusual step of signing the amendment, even though the President’s signature is not necessary under the Constitution.</p>
<p>Lincoln referred to the Corwin Amendment in his first inaugural address<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:38"" id=""fnref:38"" title=""see footnote"">[38]</a>, adding that he had “no objection” to its ratification, and he sent copies of the text to all state governors.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:39"" id=""fnref:39"" title=""see footnote"">[39]</a> Ohio, Maryland, and Illinois eventually ratified the amendment. If the country had not been distracted by war, it could well have become law, making it more difficult or even impossible to pass the 13th Amendment. </p>
<p>Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation of September 22, 1862 was further proof of his priorities. It gave the Confederate states 100 days to lay down their arms, and threatened to emancipate only those slaves living in states still in “rebellion.” Lincoln always overestimated Unionist sentiment in the South, and genuinely believed that at least some of the Southern states would accept his offer of union in exchange for the preservation of slavery.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:40"" id=""fnref:40"" title=""see footnote"">[40]</a></p>
<p>As late as the Hampton Roads conference with Confederate representatives—this was in February 3, 1865, with the war almost won—Lincoln was still hinting that the South could keep its slaves if it made peace. He called emancipation strictly a war measure that would become “inoperative” if there were peace, and suggested that if the Confederate states rejoined the union, they could defeat the 13th Amendment, which had been sent to the states for ratification. Lincoln appears to have been prepared to sacrifice the most basic interests of Blacks if he thought that would stop the slaughter of white men.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:41"" id=""fnref:41"" title=""see footnote"">[41]</a></p>
<p>Throughout his presidency, Lincoln took the conventional view that if slaves were freed, they should be expatriated. Even in the midst of the war, he was making plans for colonization, and appointed Rev. James Mitchell to be Commissioner of Emigration, with instructions to find a place to which Blacks could be sent.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:42"" id=""fnref:42"" title=""see footnote"">[42]</a> </p>
<p>On August 14th, 1862, Lincoln invited a group of free Black leaders to the White House to tell them, “there is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh as it may be, for you free colored people to remain with us.” He urged them to lead others of their race to a colonization site in Central America.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:43"" id=""fnref:43"" title=""see footnote"">[43]</a> Lincoln was the first president to invite a delegation of Blacks to the White House—and he did so to ask them to leave the country. Later that year, in a message to Congress, he argued not just for voluntary colonization but for the forcible removal of free Blacks.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:44"" id=""fnref:44"" title=""see footnote"">[44]</a></p>
<h3>A CLEAR LEGACY</h3>
<p>The record from colonial times through the end of the Civil War is therefore one of starkly inegalitarian views. The idea of colonizing Blacks was eventually abandoned as too costly, but until the second half of the 20th century, it would be very hard to find a prominent American who spoke about race in today’s terms. </p>
<p>Blacks were at the center of early American thinking about race because of the vexed question of slavery and because Blacks lived among Whites. Indians, of course, had always been present, but were of less concern. They fought rearguard actions, but generally withdrew as Whites settled the continent. When they did not withdraw, they were forced onto reservations. After the slaves were freed, Indians were legally more disadvantaged than Blacks, since they were not considered part of the United States at all. In 1884, the Supreme Court officially determined that the 14th Amendment did <em>not</em> confer citizenship on Indians associated with tribes. They did not receive citizenship until an act of Congress in 1924.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:45"" id=""fnref:45"" title=""see footnote"">[45]</a> The traditional American view—Mark Twain called the Indian “a good, fair, desirable subject for extermination if ever there was one”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:46"" id=""fnref:46"" title=""see footnote"">[46]</a>—cannot be retroactively transformed into incipient egalitarianism and celebration of diversity.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:47"" id=""fnref:47"" title=""see footnote"">[47]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was similar disdain for Asians. State and federal laws excluded them from citizenship, and as late as 1914 the Supreme Court ruled that the states could deny naturalization to Asians. Nor was the urge to exclude Asians limited to conservatives. At the 1910 Socialist Party Congress, the Committee on Immigration called for the “unconditional exclusion” of Chinese and Japanese on the grounds that America already had problems enough with Negroes.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:48"" id=""fnref:48"" title=""see footnote"">[48]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Samuel Gompers, the most famous labor leader in American history, fought to improve the lives of working people, but Whites were his first priority<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:49"" id=""fnref:49"" title=""see footnote"">[49]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be clear to every thinking man and woman that while there is hardly a single reason for the admission of Asiatics, there are hundreds of good and strong reasons for their absolute exclusion.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ban on Chinese immigration and naturalization continued until 1943, when Congress established a Chinese immigration quota—of 105 people a year.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:50"" id=""fnref:50"" title=""see footnote"">[50]</a></p>
<p>Even if we restrict the field to American Presidents—a group notoriously disinclined to say anything controversial—we find that Jefferson’s and Lincoln’s thinking of race continued well into the modern era. </p>
<p>James Garfield wrote<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:51"" id=""fnref:51"" title=""see footnote"">[51]</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I have] a strong feeling of repugnance when I think of the negro being made our political equal and I would be glad if they could be colonized, sent to heaven, or got rid of in any decent way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt wrote in 1901 that he had “not been able to think out any solution to the terrible problem offered by the presence of the Negro on this continent.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:52"" id=""fnref:52"" title=""see footnote"">[52]</a> As for Indians, he once said, “I don’t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are the dead Indians, but I believe nine out of ten are, and I shouldn’t inquire too closely into the health of the tenth.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:53"" id=""fnref:53"" title=""see footnote"">[53]</a></p>
<p>William Howard Taft once told a group of Black college students, “Your race is adapted to be a race of farmers, first, last, and for all times.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:54"" id=""fnref:54"" title=""see footnote"">[54]</a></p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson was a confirmed segregationist, and as President of Princeton he refused to admit Blacks. He enforced segregation in government offices<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:55"" id=""fnref:55"" title=""see footnote"">[55]</a> and favored exclusion of Asians: “We cannot make a homogeneous population of a people who do not blend with the Caucasian race… . Oriental coolieism will give us another race problem to solve and surely we have had our lesson.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:56"" id=""fnref:56"" title=""see footnote"">[56]</a></p>
<p>Warren Harding wanted the races separate: “Men of both races [Black and White] may well stand uncompromisingly against every suggestion of social equality. This is not a question of social equality, but a question of recognizing a fundamental, eternal, inescapable difference. Racial amalgamation there cannot be.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:57"" id=""fnref:57"" title=""see footnote"">[57]</a></p>
<p>In 1921, Vice President-elect Calvin Coolidge wrote in <em>Good Housekeeping</em> about the basis for sound immigration policy<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:58"" id=""fnref:58"" title=""see footnote"">[58]</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are racial considerations too grave to be brushed aside for any sentimental reasons. Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend…. Quality of mind and body suggests that observance of ethnic law is as great a necessity to a nation as immigration law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry Truman wrote: “I am strongly of the opinion Negroes ought to be in Africa, yellow men in Asia and white men in Europe and America.” He also referred to the Blacks on the White House staff as “an army of coons.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:59"" id=""fnref:59"" title=""see footnote"">[59]</a> </p>
<p>As recent a President as Dwight Eisenhower argued that although it might be necessary to grant Blacks certain political rights, this did not mean social equality “or that a Negro should court my daughter.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:60"" id=""fnref:60"" title=""see footnote"">[60]</a> It is only with John Kennedy that we finally find a president whose conception of race begins to be acceptable by today’s standards. </p>
<p>Today’s egalitarians are therefore radical dissenters from traditional American thinking. A conception of America as a nation of people with common values, culture, and heritage is far more faithful to vision of the founders.</p>

<p>Speaking at an “Iowans for Tax Relief” event in January, 2011, Rep. Bachmann claimed, “It didn’t matter the color of their skin, it didn’t matter their language, it didn’t matter their economic status. Once you got here, we were all the same. Isn’t that remarkable?” Taking up the slavery issue, Bachmann continued, “We also know that the very founders that wrote those documents worked tirelessly until slavery was no more in the United States.” She would later defend her position when questioned by journalists. Bachmann’s speech can be viewed <a href=""http://youtu.be/hGSCF712FCA?t=9m"">here</a>. Glenn Beck has been equally enamored with historical revisionism. Throughout his “Founding Fathers’ Fridays” series on his (now discontinued) television program, Beck featured speakers who theorized that “American history can be described as one long Civil Rights struggle” and who told tales of the indispensable contributions of Blacks to the Revolutionary War as well as racially mixed churches in 18th-century. Episodes can viewed <a href=""http://youtu.be/um1uxsKG1_0"">here</a>. Bachmann and Beck are representative of a broader tendency among conservatives. For instance, in 2011, Tennessee Tea Party activists demanded that public schools teach children that the Founders “brought liberty into a world where it hadn’t existed, to everybody—not all equally instantly.” See “<a href=""http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/jan/13/tea-parties-cite-legislative-demands/"">The Commercial Appeal</a>,” 13 January 2011.  <a class=""reversefootnote"" href=""#fnref:1"" title=""return to article""> ↩</a></p>

<meta content=""With each new election cycle, the Republican leadership becomes ever more 
convinced of its need to “reach out” to Hispanics, Blacks, and other 
minorities, or else risk irrelevance and defeat.

The votes of America’s historic Majority—namely, European Christians—are 
either taken for granted or treated as of lesser value.

The reality is that in multicultural America, Hispanics and Blacks are 
exceedingly unlikely to vote Republican, not to mention embrace 
“conservative values.”

Pursuing his “Southern Strategy” in 1968 and ’72, Richard Nixon won some 35 
and 20 percent of the Black vote; John McCain’s groveling garnered him a 
measly five.

In place of outreach to the unreachable, Republicans would be wise to 
broaden their existing White base. Complimentary to this would be a 
dedication to immigration policies that stem the influx of Democrat-voting 
Third World migrants."" property=""og:description""/>

<p>The votes of America’s historic Majority—namely, European Christians—are either taken for granted or treated as of lesser value.</p>
<p>The reality is that in multicultural America, Hispanics and Blacks are exceedingly unlikely to vote Republican, not to mention embrace “conservative values.” </p>
<p>Pursuing his “Southern Strategy” in 1968 and ’72, Richard Nixon won some 35 and 20 percent of the Black vote; John McCain’s groveling garnered him a measly five. </p>
<p>In place of outreach to the unreachable, Republicans would be wise to broaden their existing White base. Complimentary to this would be a dedication to immigration policies that stem the influx of Democrat-voting Third World migrants.</p>
<p>The “Majority Strategy,” developed first by Samuel Francis and more recently by Peter Brimelow and Steve Sailer at VDARE.com<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:1"" id=""fnref:1"" title=""see footnote"">[1]</a>, is the only realistic path to victory for Republicans. It would also ensure that future Americans inherit a country that resembles that of their ancestors. </p>
<h2>Winning the Majority</h2>
<p>The GOP is effectively The White People’s Party, whether the Republican leadership likes it or not.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:2"" id=""fnref:2"" title=""see footnote"">[2]</a> </p>
<p>Examining recent exit-polling data, in which some 60 percent of White voters supported Republican candidates—and approximately 90 percent of total Republican votes cast were by Whites—<em>National Journal</em>’s Ron Brownstein concluded: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By any standard, white voters’ rejection of Democrats in November’s elections was daunting and even historic.</p>
<p>Fully 60 percent of whites nationwide backed Republican candidates for the House of Representatives; only 37 percent supported Democrats, according to the National Election Poll exit poll conducted by Edison Research. Not even in Republicans’ 1994 congressional landslide did they win that high a percentage of the white vote.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:3"" id=""fnref:3"" title=""see footnote"">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, only White voters gave majority support to the GOP’s core positions, for example, that government should be limited in scope and programs such as “Obamacare,” repealed. </p>
<p>This European-American ingathering is mirrored by the voting patterns of non-Whites—an astonishing 80 percent of whom supported Barack Obama in 2008. In turn, major Democratic initiatives such as Obamacare find majority support only among Black and Hispanic blocs.</p>
<p>Historically, the trend is quite clear: the GOP must win a higher percentage of White voters than of the general (multi-racial) population, and often by a significant margin. </p>
<p>In 2008, John McCain won 55 percent of the White vote, mainly due to the economic downturn and unpopularity of the Bush administration. Decades earlier, when America had yet to be transformed by mass immigration, winning such a percentage of the Majority would have secured election for most any national candidate. Gerald Ford, for instance, would have been reelected in 1976 if he had won as many White votes as did McCain.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:4"" id=""fnref:4"" title=""see footnote"">[4]</a> </p>
<p>And as 2008 proved, winning a mere majority of White voters is not enough. Sweeping Republican victories (such as occurred in 1994 and 2010) are only possible with outstanding Euro-American participation. </p>
<h2>The Hispanic Republican Myth</h2>
<p>Despite the GOP’s indisputable identity, the notion that the party must convert Minorities, Hispanics in particular, to its cause remains a popular assumption. Indeed, it’s had a long shelf life. In 1988—when Hispanics were under 10 percent of the population and immigration had yet to become a national issue—Congressman Jack Kemp declared in the Heritage Foundation’s <em>Policy Review</em>, </p>
<p>I believe that in 10 years, one quarter of the Republican Party will consist of conservative blacks, conservative Hispanics, conservative Asian-Americans—or the Republican Party will resign itself to permanent minority status.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:5"" id=""fnref:5"" title=""see footnote"">[5]</a> </p>
<p>Kemp was proven quite wrong. The GOP has never come close to being a quarter Minority. And yet, a dozen years after Kemp’s pronouncement, the Republicans were able to control a majority of governorships as well both houses of Congress and the presidency; in 2012, few would dispute that the party has a chance to achieve similar dominance. </p>
<p>The GOP does not need Minorities to win, and there’s little evidence that these groups can be brought into the party any way, even with the most expert groveling. </p>
<p>In 2010, Nevada Senate candidate Sharron Angle raised eyebrows throughout her campaign by openly supporting Arizona’s tough SB 1070 immigration law and producing provocative ads featuring Hispanic gang members, border crossers, and White Arizona school children in crosshairs. Angle, who lost her race, secured only 30 percent of the Hispanic vote. Mainstream commentators concluded that Republicans must “change their tone” on the immigration issue (which was their assumption all along). </p>
<p>But did Angle’s boldness drive away Hispanics? or even affect Hispanic voting? </p>
<p>In neighboring California, Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman did everything possible to seem “Latino-friendly.” She ran ads stating “<em>No a la Proposición 187 y No a la Ley de Arizona</em>” (“No on Proposition 187 and No on Arizona’s Law.”) Whitman’s pandering—on a ballot initiative from 15 years prior and a law passed in another state—garnered her … 31 percent of the Hispanic vote, a negligible advantage over Angle, the alleged “extremist.” (And Whitman was hardly the first Republican for whom Hispanic outreach proved fruitless.)</p>
<p>The reality is that Hispanics—despite their national and ethnic diversity—bear all the hallmarks of structural voting patterns. Throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s, Republicans won less than 32 percent of the Hispanic vote. Nothing much has changed in the 21st century, despite countless immigration and “racism” controversies and billions of dollars wasted in outreach.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:6"" id=""fnref:6"" title=""see footnote"">[6]</a> (And by the way, both Whitman and Angle would have been victorious if they had won the same percentage of White voters as the GOP did nationally.) </p>
<p>In his landmark <em>Alien Nation</em> (1994), Peter Brimelow writes, “the post–1965 [Immigration Act] immigrants are overwhelmingly visible minorities. And these are precisely the groups that the Republican party has had the most difficulty recruiting.” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]his failure is not necessarily a question of the Republicans’ making nice, or nicer. It may reflect the more divergent minorities’ different values—and their more radical feeling of alienation from white American society. </p>
<p>The numbers of indisputable: Current immigration policy is inexorably reinforcing Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition. </p>
<p>That strained sound you hear is the conservative establishment whistling as they pass by the rainbow.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:7"" id=""fnref:7"" title=""see footnote"">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jackson’s actual Rainbow Coalition proved to be more smoke than fire; the Democrats’ Rainbow Party, on the other hand, is just getting started.</p>
<p>America’s racial—and subsequent political—transformation will take generations, which is why a united White population will still be able to determine national elections for years to come.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:8"" id=""fnref:8"" title=""see footnote"">[8]</a> But surely, the GOP would want to end immigration policies that inexorably increase the voting base of its rival party. This would seem such an obvious, “no brainer” strategy that even The Stupid Party might adopt it! </p>
<p>Whatever the case, the implication for 2012 are obvious, though, as Steve Sailer laments, “only semi-mentionable in polite society”: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he GOP needs to do two things—get white people to turn out; and get them to vote Republican.<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:9"" id=""fnref:9"" title=""see footnote"">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easier said than done, of course. However, there are issues that are widely (indeed, wildly) popular among traditional Americans, and which don’t divide the White vote according to “Left” and “Right.” Immigration restriction is one of them. Indeed, it could be a keystone issue for a party that could feasibly command a super-majority of Euro-American voters. </p>
<h2>Consensus Issues, not Wedge Issues</h2>
<p>Immigration restriction is often described as “controversial” and “divisive,” if not “poisonous,” by mainstream media. </p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. </p>
<p>Immigration restriction is, in fact, a consensus builder among America’s historic Majority. (And it is far less divisive than most of the issues the GOP is currently focusing on.) Whites of various backgrounds—who differ on economic and social issues—come together in recognizing mass Third World immigration as a threat to their way of life. </p>
<p>According to a NBC/Telemundo poll, 70 percent of American Whites support Arizona’s aforementioned SB1050—legislation which President Obama openly opposes and which is routinely demonized in the media as “racist.”<a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn:10"" id=""fnref:10"" title=""see footnote"">[10]</a> </p>
<p>A poll of religious Americans, conducted by the Center for Immigration Studies, is equally striking. Overall, 67 percent of observant citizens think that immigration into the U.S. is too high; and just under 80 percent of born-again Protestants—the GOP’s indispensable bloc—think so. </p>
<p>Despite politicians’ frequent paeans to “democracy,” with the mass immigration issue, the will of the people diverges most dramatically from the consensus of the political establishment.</p>
<p>For Republicans, this is a major opportunity. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Throughout history, August Comte’s famous maxim has proven true again and again—“<em>demography is destiny</em>.” And whether they are willing to formulate it as such, Republicans are engaged in a demographic struggle for their survival. </p>
<p>Brownstein lays out their challenge in no uncertain terms: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he key question for 2012 may be whether Republicans can increase their advantage among whites enough to overcome what’s likely to be a growing share of the overall vote cast by minorities, who still break preponderantly for Democrats. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if the GOP can’t expand its Majority voting base, then Obama could be reelected by Minorities. </p>
<p>The unsettling result would be a national leader supported by populations that don’t identify with America’s European heritage and Founding culture, and many of whom have only recently become citizens. </p>
<p>All of that sounds dire… But the Republicans are lucky in that the strategy that will grant them victory—likely the only strategy that will do so—is morally justified. Who could deny a nation the right to maintain its traditions, culture, and heritage? </p>
<p>By adopting The Majority Strategy, Republicans would not just be saving themselves, they would be saving their country.</p>

<hr/></div></div><div class=""sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code"" data-block-type=""23"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_28_1421031014931_14093""><div class=""sqs-block-content""><p>The March issue of <em><a href=""http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/his-panic/"">The American Conservative</a></em> features Ron Unz’s long essay, “His-Panic: The Myth of Hispanic Criminality.” His surprising conclusion, contrary to most of the technical literature, is that Hispanics in the U.S. do not commit crimes at higher rates than white Americans.</p>
<p>Unz’s article is laudable for its straightforward, dispassionate discussion of a sensitive issue. His methodology, however, is problematic, and his conclusion is wrong. A proper analysis of the data indicates that Hispanics have a substantially higher crime rate than whites.</p>
<p>The key statistic here is the Hispanic incarceration rate divided by the white incarceration rate. Let’s call this number HDW for short. So hypothetically, if four out of every 100 Hispanics are in prison, and two out of every 100 whites are in prison, then the HDW is two, meaning Hispanics are incarcerated at twice the white rate.</p>
<p>At first glance, the national HDW seems to be rather damaging to Unz’s case. Table 13 in the 2005 Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) report, featured prominently in Unz’s article, makes the HDW calculation straightforward. When we include prisoners of both genders and all ages in federal, state, and local confinement, HDW is 2.62.</p>
<p>But the main point of Unz’s article is that 2.62 is a major overestimation. Unz prefers to use only the state and local incarceration data found in table 14, which immediately reduces HDW to 1.80. He then crudely controls for age and gender, which gets him down to the 1.1 to 1.3 range. With a national HDW this close to one, Hispanics are actually seen to be less crime prone than whites in several states, including Florida where HDW is below 0.5. Only in the Northeast are Hispanics still substantially more criminal than whites.</p>
<p>Unz goes on to cite surprisingly low crime rates in certain majority Hispanic areas, and he concludes by saying: “Taken as a whole, the mass of statistical evidence constitutes strong support for the ‘null hypothesis,’ namely that Hispanics have approximately the same crime rates as whites of the same age.”</p>
<h2>The Mystery Of The BJS Data</h2>
<p>The problems start with Unz’s exclusion of the federal prison data. His reason is superficially plausible–the sole offense of some Hispanics in federal custody may be an illegal border crossing. It hardly seems fair, as Unz writes, to group “illegal nannies convicted of illegal nannying” with robbers and rapists who are typically put in state prisons. After throwing out the federal data and reducing HDW from 2.62 to 1.80, Unz says the reduction “presumably reflect[s] the exclusion of immigration-related federal offenses.”</p>
<p>That’s not true at all. The reduction mainly reflects the vagaries of state-level data collection. The reality is that relatively few people are held in federal prison for immigration violations unless they have also committed a more serious crime. It would be difficult to find any illegal nannies doing hard time.</p>
<p>Hispanics in PrisonIn fact, the BJS data make it clear that mere immigration-related offenses cannot explain the reduction in HDW when the federal data are thrown out. As Matthew Roberts and Steve Burton recently pointed out in Chronicles, the number of people in federal prison for immigration violations is very small compared to the combined number of Hispanics in federal, state, and local custody. Even under the strong assumption that they should all be discounted, immigration-related offenses can account for only a tiny part of the HDW reduction.</p>
<p>Confronted with that observation, Unz developed a new reason to exclude the federal data–too many cases of drug smuggling, which he says are perpetrated by Mexican “drug mules,” not real Hispanic Americans. This is a weak argument, since otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants also go back and forth across the border. Should they not count as American residents either?</p>
<p>But the larger point here is that neither immigration nor drugs nor anything else can even come close to explaining the HDW reduction. The BJS has actually published incarceration data that are grossly inconsistent.</p>
<p>Consider that table 13 of the BJS report lists incarceration rates at the combined federal, state, and local level. The resulting HDW, as discussed above, is 2.62. We know exactly how many federal prisoners are white versus Hispanic, so we can subtract them out and get just state and local rates. (Note that we have eliminated not just immigration or drug violators, but all federal prisoners.) When we do that, HDW moves from 2.62 to 2.44.</p>
<p>Now, table 14 reports state and local incarceration data only. We would expect the HDW derived from table 14 to be right around 2.44 as well, but it is actually the 1.80 that Unz uses. What causes this large discrepancy? It’s a mystery. I’ve spoken with two different statisticians at the BJS about this problem, but neither had a good answer, other than to say that the two tables are calculated from different source material.</p>
<p>I can speculate that some states in table 14 have counted many Hispanics as white, which would explain why the HDW is unusually low compared to other estimates. In any case, when one table implies a state and local HDW that is over 35 percent higher than what is reported by another table, we must conclude that the report is not reliable enough for our purposes. Unfortunately, all of Unz’s national and state-level analyses depend on it.</p>
<h2>The Generational Issue</h2>
<p>An even more serious problem with Unz’s analysis is his glossing over of the generational issue. U.S.-born Hispanics are much more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born Hispanics. Though it may seem counter-intuitive, this is a finding that is well known to researchers in the field, and it implies that Hispanic crime will become more of a problem as time goes on, not less.</p>
<p>While neighborhoods with mostly first-generation Hispanics do not have a large crime problem, entrenched Hispanic communities are usually more dangerous. In many of Unz’s most prominent examples of low-crime Hispanic communities–Silicon Valley, the Jackson Heights section of Queens, even Los Angeles proper–the adult Hispanic population is primarily immigrant.</p>
<p>This immigrant-native dichotomy is also one of the reasons that some states, particularly those in the South, appear to have such law-abiding Hispanics. Unz writes that Hispanics have crime rates “somewhat higher than white New Englanders, but somewhat lower than white Southerners.” However, most Hispanic adults in the South, especially in states like Georgia and Florida, are immigrants. The reality is that U.S.-born Hispanics have a significantly higher crime rate than whites in every state in the union. Hispanic crime is not just a regional problem.</p>
<p>Unz adds: “There actually does exist a connection between poverty and crime … and … there is every reason to expect this crime rate will drop further as Hispanics continue to move up the economic ladder.” Wrong. Consider again what happens between the first and second generations. The children of Hispanic immigrants are much wealthier and better educated than their parents, but they also commit crimes at higher rates. The poverty-crime correlation here is negative, not positive.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn1"" id=""ffn1"">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Unz downplays the second generation increase in crime by stating, correctly, that the magnitude of the increase has been exaggerated by unreliable Census data on the immigrant status of prisoners. However, the crime increase among U.S.-born Hispanics is still quite real and substantial. According to the Center for Immigration Studies report that Unz cites, the Census Bureau has vastly improved the accuracy of its immigration status variable since 2000.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">2</a></sup></p>
<p>An annual mini-census called the American Community Survey (ACS) still shows a large crime increase in U.S.-born generations, and a similar increase is evident in independent survey data. Furthermore, elevated crime in the Hispanic U.S.-born generation is consistent with an increase in several other underclass behaviors. Labor force dropout, illegitimacy, and welfare usage are all much higher among Hispanic natives than among Hispanic immigrants. Crime is no different.</p>
<h2>Better Estimates Of Hispanic Crime</h2>
<p>So how do we get a good estimate of HDW? Probably the best method is to use the recent ACS data on institutionalization.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">3</a></sup> The pooled 2006 through 2008 dataset provides a large sample that can be cleanly broken down by age, gender, race, immigrant status, and state of residence.</p>
<p>The dataset is certainly not perfect. Minor lingering problems with the immigration status variable cannot be ruled out, and federal prisoners are included. However, we have seen that federal crimes, especially immigration crimes, account for a rather small portion of incarcerations. The underlying conclusions described below remain unaffected by these minor objections.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes HDW for a variety of Hispanic groups using ACS data. The analysis is limited to men ages 16 through 64, and the numbers are statistically controlled for age and state of residence using regression analysis. To illustrate, U.S.-born men of Mexican ancestry are 2.4 times more likely to be institutionalized compared to white men who are the same age and who live in the same state.</p></div></div><div class=""sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code"" data-block-type=""23"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_28_1421031014931_8117""><div class=""sqs-block-content""><style type=""text/css"">

Combine the generations together and we get an HDW of about 1.8, which can be expected to go up as more Hispanics are born in the U.S.

To put 1.8 in perspective, the black to white rate is roughly 6.2. Fears that Hispanic areas of the country will become as dangerous as black ghettoes are clearly unfounded. Ron Unz is right to say that there is no massive Hispanic crime wave coming to America.

This being said, Unz is wrong when he says that Hispanics are no more criminal than whites. Hispanics are, in fact, substantially more likely than whites to commit serious crimes, and U.S.-born Hispanics in particular are about two and a half times more likely. These findings are not due to age differences or immigration violations or other statistical artifacts. The reality of Hispanic crime should be one of the many factors we consider when setting immigration policy.</div></div><div class=""sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code"" data-block-type=""23"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_28_1421031014931_15358""><div class=""sqs-block-content""><br/>

<li id=""fn3"">Though recognized as a good proxy for incarceration, “institutionalization” also applies to people in mental hospitals and nursing homes. Given the pre-retirement age range I use, nursing homes should not be skewing the data.

<meta content='In the Victorian era, the Great Taboo was sex. Today, whatever the label we 
attach to our own age, the Great Taboo is race. The Victorians virtually 
denied that sex existed. Today, race is confidently said to be ""merely a

imaginations at that, rather than a reality of nature. The Victorians 
severely punished people who talked about sex, made jokes about sex, or 
wrote too openly and frankly about sex. Today, journalists, disc jockeys, 
leading sports figures, public officials, distinguished academics, and 
major political leaders who violate the racial taboos of our age are fired 
from their newspapers, networks, or radio stations, forced to resign their 
positions, condemned by their own colleagues, and subjected to 
""investigations"" of their ""backgrounds"" and their ""links"" to other 
individuals and groups that have also violated the race taboo. We have not, 
at least in this country so far, reached the point where violating the race 
taboo brings criminal prosecution and imprisonment, as in both Europe and 
Canada it may well do, but there are several cases of supposed ""white 
supremacists"" being arrested or harassed by law enforcement agencies 
largely because of their alleged beliefs about race, and the constant 
agitation for ever more stringent measures against ""hate crimes"" and ""hate 
speech"" seems to point toward the eventual official entrenchment of the 
race taboo in formal law. Meanwhile, if the government is still restricted 
in the action it can take to stifle and suppress ""racism,"" the

denounce, vilify, spy on, demonstrate against, intimidate, and even 
occasionally assault and beat up individuals and organizations that have

Francis.</em> </p>
<p>In the Victorian era, the Great Taboo was sex. Today, whatever the label we attach to our own age, the Great Taboo is race. The Victorians virtually denied that sex existed. Today, race is confidently said to be ""merely a social construct,"" a product of the imagination, and of none too healthy imaginations at that, rather than a reality of nature. The Victorians severely punished people who talked about sex, made jokes about sex, or wrote too openly and frankly about sex. Today, journalists, disc jockeys, leading sports figures, public officials, distinguished academics, and major political leaders who violate the racial taboos of our age are fired from their newspapers, networks, or radio stations, forced to resign their positions, condemned by their own colleagues, and subjected to ""investigations"" of their ""backgrounds"" and their ""links"" to other individuals and groups that have also violated the race taboo. We have not, at least in this country so far, reached the point where violating the race taboo brings criminal prosecution and imprisonment, as in both Europe and Canada it may well do, but there are several cases of supposed ""white supremacists"" being arrested or harassed by law enforcement agencies largely because of their alleged beliefs about race, and the constant agitation for ever more stringent measures against ""hate crimes"" and ""hate speech"" seems to point toward the eventual official entrenchment of the race taboo in formal law. Meanwhile, if the government is still restricted in the action it can take to stifle and suppress ""racism,"" the ""anti-racist"" political left seems to enjoy virtual carte blanche to denounce, vilify, spy on, demonstrate against, intimidate, and even occasionally assault and beat up individuals and organizations that have transgressed the racial Victorianism of our age.</p>
<p>If the analogy between the Victorian taboo on sex and the contemporary taboo on race is valid, then the essays in this book are logically the analogue of pornography, or what conventional Victorians regarded as pornography. Every one of these essays deals with race in a way that the dominant culture of the present day rejects, forbids, and indeed punishes by one means or another. Every one of them deals with aspects of race—its reality as a part of the biological and psychological nature of man and its importance as a social and historical force—that contemporary culture is at best reluctant to discuss at all and absolutely refuses to acknowledge as true. At the same time, in contradiction to the stereotype promoted by ""anti-racist"" forces, not one of these essays or their authors expresses here or anywhere else any desire to harm, exploit, dominate, or deny the legitimate rights of other races. This book is not a tract promoting ""white supremacy"" or the restoration of forced segregation.</p>
<p>All the contributors to this volume are white, well educated, and articulate; several are or have been academics or professional journalists and authors, and what unites and drives them as a group is a common concern that their race today faces a crisis that within the coming century and in the United States and Europe could easily lead to either its physical extinction, its subordination to and persecution by other races, or the destruction of its civilization.</p>
<p>Most readers who continue to believe what the dominant culture tells them about the meaning and significance of race will find this concern bizarre. They will at once respond that in the first place, as noted, race does not really exist or, if it does, that it consists of nothing more than superficial and socially irrelevant features of gross physical morphol-ogy—skin color, hair texture, height, perhaps skull shape, etc. Even if race does exist as a biological reality, it certainly has no meaning for behavior, culture, intelligence, or other traits that influence and shape social institutions. Moreover, any effort to take race more seriously is either a deliberate and covert attempt to justify racial hatred or injustice, or is at best a misguided enterprise that is all too likely to lead to hatred, injustice, and even genocide, as it has in the past. This is the conventional attitude toward race that the dominant culture in the West today promotes and enforces, and it is precisely from that attitude and its unspoken premises that the authors of these essays dissent.</p>
<p>The commonly held beliefs about race mentioned above—that it does not exist or is not important and that serious concern about race and racial identity leads to negative and undesirable consequences—are wrong, as these essays demonstrate, and yet it is precisely those beliefs that make it impossible for whites who accept them to preserve themselves as a race—as what scientist J. Philippe Rushton defines as ""a group related by common descent, blood, or heredity”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn1"" id=""ffn1"">[1]</a></sup>—and the civilization and political institutions their race has created. White racial consciousness, the shared awareness of whites that their racial identity and heritage are real and important and worth preserving, is by far the most taboo of all beliefs about race, a taboo that is not enforced consistently or at all against the consciousness of other races. As black historian Shelby Steele acknowledged in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (November 13, 2003), ""Racial identity is simply forbidden to whites in America and across the entire Western world. Black children today are hammered with the idea of racial identity and pride, yet racial pride in whites constitutes a grave evil. Say I'm white and I'm proud' and you are a Nazi.” Mr. Steele, however, was certainly not pointing to the double standard in order to promote or legitimize white consciousness. Indeed, he made use of the widely shared (by non-whites as well as whites) demonic view of whites to reject and deny any white claim to their own racial identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No group in recent history has more aggressively seized power in the name of its racial superiority than Western whites. This race illustrated for all time—through colonialism, slavery, white racism, Nazism—the extraordinary human evil that follows when great power is joined to an atavistic sense of superiority and destiny. This is why today's whites, the world over, cannot openly have a racial identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Louis Farrakhan, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson, as well as Hispanic leaders like Cruz Bustamante and Mario Obledo, have no problem exulting in their own racial identity and exhorting their people in support of racial solidarity and the political power they expect such solidarity to yield, exultations and exhortations that are often expressed in language that is explicitly anti-white, in the most primitive and threatening terms. Yet they are seldom called to account for it and are often rewarded, if not because of it, at least in spite of it. When Mr. Obledo, for example, proclaimed a few years ago, ""California is going to be a Mexican state, we are going to control all the institutions. If people don't like it they should leave—go back to Europe,"" he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Clinton soon afterward. It is not very likely that a prominent white leader today who said, as Senator Stephen Douglas in a debate with Abraham Lincoln in 1858 did say, ""I believe this government was made on the white basis. I believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever"" would be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Douglas's comment (and many similar ones) expressed a sentiment more or less parallel to Mr. Obledo's, though Douglas did not go so far as to invite non-whites to leave the country (it was Lincoln himself who did that in his proposal for the expatriation of blacks a few years later; in any case the state of Illinois had already outlawed free black residency in its constitution, so it was not an issue in the election). Douglas in fact won the election and was the Democratic Party's national candidate for president two years later.</p>
<p>Indeed, in contrast to the rewards heaped on Mr. Obledo, when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott in December 2002 made his casual remark that the country would have been better off had Strom Thurmond won the 1948 presidential election, he was denounced by more than a solid week of public obloquy from both the political right and left and hounded into resigning his leadership position in the U.S. Senate. Mr. Lott had said nothing about race or Mr. Thurmond's segregationist platform in that election, nor did he utter any racial epithets or insults, and there was no evidence he was even thinking about that aspect of the campaign; but he was obliged to engage in protracted and repeated retractions, explanations, and apologies anyway—all to no avail. The same is true of baseball player John Rocker, whose acerbic remarks in a 1999 interview in <em>Sports Illustrated</em> about riding the subway in New York City contained no racial allusions whatever but were widely interpreted as referring to race. Mr. Rocker was obliged to undergo psychiatric counseling because of his remarks and was fortunate in not being professionally ruined.</p>
<p>One main reason for the obvious double standard on the racial consciousness that is permitted for and even demanded of non-white racial groups but forbidden to whites is that non-whites are easily inflamed and mobilized by the slightest or merely apparent suggestions of white identity, consciousness, solidarity, or pride by eminent public figures like Sen. Lott or Mr. Rocker, and their mobilization can have disastrous consequences for institutions—the Republican Party, the Atlanta Braves— that seek or depend on non-white votes or market patronage. Non-white racial consciousness facilitates both mass political and economic mobilization against the white enemy and is almost unfailingly successful in intimidating such institutions into firing, demoting, or penalizing the white transgressors, and often in paying immense sums to compensate for any racial wrongs, real or imagined, inflicted (as did the restaurant chain Denny's because of class action lawsuits brought by black patrons who alleged racial discrimination in service). Yet non-white racial solidarity and antagonism are by no means the only reasons why whites ""cannot openly have a racial identity.""</p>
<p>The truth is that whites deny themselves a racial identity, and one major reason they do so is that many of them, especially in white elites, buy into or accept, consciously or unconsciously, premises that deny the reality and significance of race, as well as unquestioned beliefs about the evilness and worthlessness of whites themselves. Mr. Steele can utter sweeping generalizations about ""the extraordinary human evil"" that whites have exhibited throughout their history (entirely ignoring the long and brutal history of slavery, conquest, genocide, and repression by nonwhites in Africa and Asia that persists to this day) in a major newspaper owned and managed by whites simply because it does not occur to most members of the white elite to question the expression of this kind of anti-white opinion. To some extent white tolerance of such anti-white sentiments is due to the racial guilt that has been injected into white minds, but to a larger degree it is due simply to ignorance, indifference, and an intellectually lazy refusal to question the denial of race and the demoniza-tion of whites that have come to prevail in the Western world and to the conviction, promulgated by ideologically driven academics, the media, and almost all public figures, that race does not exist or is not important, at least for whites.</p>
<p>The consequences of this denial and demonization for whites and the civilization they have created and ruled for the last several centuries are what concerns the contributors to this collection of essays. The processes by which those consequences may come about are already apparent. For more than a decade it has been acknowledged (by the U.S. Census Bureau and leading demographers) that due to mass non-white immigration and the differential fertility rates between whites and non-whites, by approximately the year 2050 the United States will cease to be a majority white country for the first time in its history. As with other aspects of racial reality, most whites seem to be either ignorant of that projection or indifferent to it, but some—such as former President Bill Clinton—actually welcome it. In an interview with black journalists in the White House on June 11, 1997, <em>Boston Globe</em> columnist Derrick Jackson reported, President Clinton remarked that the coming racial transformation of the country ""will arguably be the third great revolution in America,"" proving that we can live ""without in effect having a dominant European culture. We want to become a multiracial, multiethnic society. We're not going to disintegrate in the face of it"" (<em>Boston Globe</em>, June 13, 1997). Mr. Clinton's opinion is by no means confined to those of his liberal convictions. In 1996, in the course of the debate over immigration in California, U.S. Rep. Robert Dornan, one of the most conservative members of the Congress, boasted of his indifference to race and skin color in a campaign speech. ""I want to see America stay a nation of immigrants,"" he intoned not long before election day, ""and if we lose our Northern European stock—your coloring and mine, blue eyes and fair hair—tough!"" Moreover, George W. Bush himself, campaigning in August 2000, proclaimed to a Hispanic audience in Miami his own vision of the coming multiracial, multicultural America:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America has one national creed, but many accents. We are now one of the largest Spanish-speaking nations in the world. We're a major source of Latin music, journalism and culture. </p>
<p>Just go to Miami, or San Antonio, Los Angeles, Chicago or West New York, New Jersey...and close your eyes and listen. You could just as easily be in Santo Domingo or Santiago, or San Miguel de Allende. </p>
<p>For years our nation has debated this change—some have praised it and others have resented it. By nominating me, my party has made a choice to welcome the new America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these white leaders and many others like them no doubt assume that the multiracial future of the country will not threaten whites or the country because all races accept or are coming to accept the rejections of race that are now prevalent in their own minds and in the culture and public policies they reflect and promote. But this assumption is demonstrably wrong. The evidence is that while whites are either publicly oblivious to their own racial identity and interests or are actually anti-white, non-whites, as Mr. Steele noted, are insistent on the importance of racial identity and consciousness and concerted public action based on racial identity. The policy of racial ""color blindness"" on which the ""civil rights revolution"" was supposedly founded has turned out to be a fraud and a failure. Like most revolutions, the one led by non-whites like Martin Luther King, Jr. moved from a moderate phase demanding merely equal treatment and the end of legal racial discrimination to a far more radical stage demanding outright racial privileges for non-whites (through affirmative action) and a myriad of special exemptions and policies designed to benefit and empower non-whites (e.g., allowing or encouraging exclusively black, Hispanic, or Indian clubs, associations, and political groups and not infrequently forcing whites to subsidize them, but rigorously forbidding and denouncing such racially distinctive groups for whites) and at the same time attacking and demonizing white institutions, icons, symbols, and heroes, and eventually whites themselves as a group. It is the radical phase of the revolution that has now become established and threatens to become even more radical as non-white numbers and power increase, as non-white racial consciousness evolves to higher and more aggressive levels of expression, and as a prohibited white racial consciousness continues to dwindle and the white capacity to mobilize resistance to racial aggression vanishes with it.</p>
<p>""Color blindness,"" in other words, has failed, if it was ever seriously intended in the first place, and the main reason it failed is that it denied a biological reality. Today, after decades of such denial, race has been rediscovered. It has been rediscovered in two ways. First, race has been rediscovered scientifically as a factual reality of nature. The work of scientists like Arthur Jensen, William Shockley, J. Philippe Rushton, H. J. Eysenck, Richard Lynn, Richard Herrnstein, and a number of others has established, contrary to the claims of the Franz Boas ""environmentalist"" or ""social determinist"" school of the social sciences, that race exists and is a significant factor in such human mental traits as intelligence. There is really little doubt about this today, and fewer and fewer scientists dispute it, though few also are willing to risk their careers by talking or writing about it in violation of the race taboo. Indeed, the reality of biologically based differences between the races has been known for decades, if not longer, and as long ago as 1981 Arthur Jensen could itemize a host of such differences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different races have evolved in somewhat different ways, making for many differences among them. A few of the many physical characteristics found to display genetic variation between different races are body size and proportions, hair form and distribution, head shape and facial features, cranial capacity and brain formation, blood types, number of vertebrae, size of genitalia, bone density, fingerprints, basic metabolic rate, body temperature, blood pressure, heat and cold tolerance, number and distribution of sweat glands, odor, consistency of ear wax, number of teeth, age at eruption of permanent teeth, fissural patterns on the surfaces of the teeth, length of gestation period, frequency of twin births, male-female birth ratio, physical maturity at birth, rate of infant development of alpha brain waves, colorblindness, visual and auditory acuity, intolerance of milk, galvanic skin resistance, chronic diseases, susceptibility to infectious diseases, genetic diseases (e.g., Tay-Sachs, sickle cell anemia), and pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Kevin Lamb shows in his essay in this book, the scientific evidence for the natural reality and social significance of race is now overwhelming, despite the persistence and prevalence of race denial in public forums. And as Richard Lynn, one of the scientific pioneers in the discovery of racial differences, shows in his own essay, racial differences in intelligence and behavior patterns significantly affect such societal differences as levels of technological achievement, political stability and freedom, criminal violence, and standards of living. What kind of society and how much civilization a people creates is now clearly known to be related to what kind of race they are. Race—a concept that includes far more than skin color and encompasses the collective and distinctive genetic endowments of a people—by itself is certainly not sufficient to create civilization, but it is necessary to creating it. Take away the white race that created the civilization that has continued from ancient Egypt to today, and the civilization will wither. Non-whites may indeed create a different civilization of their own, but it will not be the same as the one we as whites created and live in, and most of us (or even most nonwhites today) would not want to live in it.</p>
<p>The recognition of the reality and significance of race does not imply or lead to ""hate"" or domination of one race by another, but racial differentiation does imply social differentiation—that is, the existence of significant biological differences between groups of human beings means there will probably be social differences between them: differences in educational and economic achievement, personal and political behavior, and social and cultural institutions. And if there is social differentiation between races, then competition and conflict between them is also likely, especially if they occupy the same territory. ""Hatred,"" domination, and racial antagonism may therefore result, not as relationships to be desired or advocated, but as the consequence of the natural reality of racial differences and the effort to ignore or deny such differences by the delusions of ""multiracialism,"" ""multiculturalism,"" ""universalism,"" and ""egalitarianism.""</p>
<p>The second way in which race has been rediscovered is as a social and political force, the racial consciousness and solidarity discussed above that in the last century has swept through the non-white populations of the United States and the world. This rediscovery constitutes what Lothrop Stoddard in the frank language of the 1920s called ""The Rising Tide of Color against White World Supremacy"" and is identical to what the late Robert Nisbet termed the ""racial revolution."" While Marxism, Nisbet wrote, ""has, on the whole, endeavored to persuade blacks and other races historically under white domination that they fall into the more general category of the proletariat,"" the ""single fact...that stands out"" is ""that racial revolution as an aspiration is becoming increasingly separate from other philosophies or strategies of revolution.""</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The distinguishing feature of twentieth-century revolutionary behavior and thought has proved to be...precisely its racial character. The signal revolts of the past half-century, the major insurrections and mass liberations, have been precisely those buoyed up by appeal to race and color. The greatest single twentieth-century revolutionary movement has been that of the blacks, revolting against not capitalists primarily, but whites—in Africa and, to a modified degree, in the United States and other Western countries.</p>
<p>And ethnic revolt—whether black, Oriental, Chicano, or whatever—has commonly carried with it hostility to all manifestations of Western-white culture, not merely those identifiable as capitalist.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">[3]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What has occurred in the last century, then, consists of two processes— first, the evisceration of white racial consciousness and identity (through the pseudoscientific denial of race, the political and cultural demoniza-tion of whites, and the political and legal destruction of white political and cultural power) and second, the development, around the same time, of the non-white and increasingly anti-white racial consciousness that animates the emerging national non-white majority and similar emerging majorities in other white countries. The scientific rediscovery of race as a socially and historically significant reality of nature is part of a reaction against the ""racial revolution"" and can be expected to assist in the revival and relegitimization of white racial identity, but by itself it remains largely an academic abstraction understood by only a handful of scientists and scholars. It is no doubt necessary to instigate a revived white racial consciousness but alone is not sufficient to ensure the survival of whites as a race or of their civilization.</p>
<p>What is necessary is an explicit revival of white racial consciousness, in opposition to the anti-white racial consciousness now engulfing whites and their societies and to the denial of race that is commonplace in white public rhetoric and the dominant public ideology. There are three general reasons why a revival of white racial consciousness and identity is needed.</p>
<p>In the first place, we now know enough about the biologically grounded cognitive and behavioral differences between the races to be able to say with confidence that race deeply affects and shapes cultural life. Certainly neither the modern West, with its scientific and technological achievements, nor the ancient West, with its vast political organization and sophisticated artistic, literary, and philosophical legacies, could have been produced by races with a lower level of cognitive capacity, nor is the dynamism characteristic of white Westerners—their inclinations to innovation, exploration, expansion, and conquest—apparent among most non-white races, even if their cognitive capacities are greater than those of whites. As noted above, what kind of society and how much civilization a people creates is now clearly known to be related to what kind of race they are, and the decline or disappearance of the white race can be anticipated to impoverish what remains of Western civilization, however much ""evil"" black apologists like Shelby Steele may attribute to it.</p>
<p>Second, however, regardless of the role of biologically based racial differences in accounting for behavioral and cultural differences, whites, like any race, should wish to survive and flourish simply for their own sake, just as we would wish our family, our community, our country, our civilization to survive and flourish, whatever their merits or flaws. Even this minimal rationale for racial survival is denied to whites today because of the constant demonization of whites that non-whites and whites themselves heap on them and because of the blindness of whites—like Congressman Dornan, quoted above—to their own racial identity.</p>
<p>And third, white racial consciousness is necessary simply as a means of self-protection. White racial identity is an integral component of the historic identity of America as a culture and a nation. The emergence of an explicit racial consciousness among non-whites in a country that remains (so far) majority white and in which whites have constituted the culturally defining and dominant race creates tensions that are already obvious and threaten to become far more dangerous and destabilizing in the future. As Jared Taylor notes in his essay in this volume, explicit white racial consciousness has been a commonplace and important feature of American history, a belief that has shaped the events, leaders, institutions, and norms that have defined us as a people and a nation throughout our past and in all regions. As I noted some years ago, for white Americans today to abandon the concept of race and adopt ""racial universalism"" would mean ""not simply an adjustment or a reform,' let alone a continuation of the proper direction of American history, but a revolutionary reconstruction of the American identity.""</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You cannot have it both ways: either you define the American nation as the product of its past and learn to live with the reality of race and the reality of the racial particularism and racial nationalism that in part defines our national history, or you reject race as meaningful and important, as anything more than skin color and gross morphology, and demand that anyone, past or present, who believes or believed that race means anything more than that be demonized and excluded from any positive status in our history or the formation of our identity. If you reject race, then you reject America as it has really existed throughout its history, and whatever you mean by ""America"" has to come from something other than its real past.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn4"" id=""ffn4"">[4]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even more dangerously, the absence of racial consciousness among whites disarms them as a group in confrontation with races that possess such a consciousness. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and other non-white racial and ethnic groups are able to act and react in highly unified patterns, political and cultural, to protect or advance what their leaders perceive as their racial interests and, in particular, to resist, denounce, and attack any manifestation of white racial solidarity.</p>
<p>Whites are unable to so act and react because they do not exist as a self-conscious racial group. Whites may be more or less unified with respect to objective material characteristics—income, educational achievement, patterns of residence, voting behavior, etc.—but they are not unified and indeed barely even exist with respect to subjective racial consciousness and identity, and are therefore at a disadvantage in meeting competitive challenges from groups that are unified by explicit racial consciousness and identity. Divided by various class, regional, political, ideological, religious, and other differences, whites will face a dangerous and uncertain future in a society dominated by racially unified non-whites. At a time when anti-white racial and ethnic groups define themselves in explicitly racial terms, only our own unity and identity as a race will be able to meet their challenge. If and when that challenge should triumph and those enemies come to kill us as the Tutsis were slaughtered in Rwanda or as Robert Mugabe has threatened to do to whites in Zimbabwe, they will do so not because we are ""Westerners"" or ""Americans"" or ""Christians"" or ""conservatives"" or ""liberals,"" but because we are white.</p>
<p>What political forms a new white racial consciousness might or should take is not yet clear, but at least it must be sufficiently strong and widespread to be able to resist and balance the anti-white tide that threatens whites. Given the intensity of non-white racial consciousness, the emergence of a counterbalancing white consciousness may well lead to violent conflict between the races. There is in fact an immense level of violent conflict against whites going on right now through interracial crime and terrorism, conflict that is abetted by judicial constraints imposed on law enforcement; by gun control measures that disarm law-abiding whites against armed non-white criminals; by mass immigration, legal and illegal; and by the deliberate refusal of ruling white elites to enforce their own laws and protect their own people and communities. Violent and authoritarian resolutions of the racial conflict of our age are certainly not desirable and are not advocated by anyone contributing to this collection, but violence and repression are sufficiently common in human history that they cannot be excluded as eventual consequences, despite our preferences.</p>
<p>Although, as historian William McNeill has pointed out, racial supremacy or what he calls ""ethnic hierarchy"" has been the norm in multiracial societies throughout history<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn5"" id=""ffn5"">[5]</a></sup>, the restoration of white racial supremacy in the United States today is not desirable or probably even possible. As Sam G. Dickson notes in his essay in this volume on race and the South, the core of Robert E. Lee's personal objection to Southern slavery was that it encouraged the corruption of the whites, a corruption that cripples and weakens whites in creating free social orders and high civilizations. In multiracial societies in which significant cognitive differences between the races exist, the level of civilization that can be sustained tends to be limited. A race that dominates another needs to establish what is essentially an authoritarian system of political and social control that inhibits the dominant race almost as much as it restrains the subject race. It is hardly an accident that so many multiracial empires in human history have been authoritarian regimes in which the dominant race monopolizes power. A ruling race also needs to maintain constant vigilance and live in perpetual trepidation of racial revolt, violence, crime, and political destabilization, to guard against subversion of the racial order by its own disaffected members, and to worry about and prevent its own demographic displacement by the subject race through differential fertility rates and interracial breeding. Moreover, the racial supremacy of whites over other ethnic and racial groups rarely endures for long. Throughout their racial history from the prehistoric Indo-European invasions of Western Asia and India to the nineteenth century, whites have almost always conquered and dominated the peoples with whom they came in prolonged contact, at least until they themselves were displaced or absorbed by the very populations they conquered. What we are seeing today in countries like Zimbabwe and South Africa as well as more protractedly in Europe, Australia, and the United States and Canada—the revolt of once-subordinate non-whites against the once-dominant white race—is in essence merely a repetition on a grand scale of what seems to have happened to the Indo-European aristocracies of non-Indo-European peoples in antiquity, the ruling class of the Roman Empire, and the Frankish Crusaders who conquered the Near East in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.</p>
<p>Whites who today continue to harbor romantic images of the lost paradise of white supremacy should reflect that the civilization whites actually created usually originated in what were the largely racially homogeneous populations of Europe, not in those where racial oligarchies prevailed (and eventually failed to prevail). White supremacy was able to exist at all only because whites possessed a powerful racial consciousness, and non-whites did not. Today, that situation is reversed—with ominous implications for the dwindling white population.</p>
<p>Probably the most desirable and mutually satisfactory (if not the most likely) resolution of the escalating racial conflict would be the voluntary separation of races into distinct nations. There are obvious problems with such a division of the national territory—who would get which part, what would happen to those of one race who refused to leave the areas assigned to another race, who would be counted as part of a race and why, how would the separation be authorized, how would each section be governed, etc. Moreover, most white Americans would recoil from endorsing an actual territorial division of the nation for whatever reason. Racial separatism, far more than ""white supremacy,"" is today favored by most whites advocating white racial consciousness, but there appears to be little prospect of the larger white population embracing it in the near future. Nor is ""racial federalism,"" under which local communities or even whole states determine their own racial arrangements, laws, and policies, likely. The insistence by nationally dominant elites that race and immigration policies that are effectively anti-white be determined entirely by the centralized state under their own control means that localism and federalism are no more probable in race relations than in most other areas of American public life.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if whites cannot expect a total, permanent, and mutually satisfactory resolution of the racial conflict through separation or federalism, they can at least work to achieve results that would protect or guarantee their own survival and that of their civilization. The political, legal, and cultural agenda on which whites should insist includes a permanent moratorium on all legal immigration into the United States, the expulsion of illegal aliens, the rigorous enforcement of laws against illegal immigration, and the removal of incentives to further illegal immigration (e.g., availability of welfare, education, and affirmative action for illegal aliens and of automatic birthright citizenship for their children); the end of all ""affirmative action"" programs and policies and of all ""civil rights"" laws that discriminate against whites and circumscribe their constitutional rights of association; the repeal of all ""hate crime"" laws and ""Politically Correct"" policies and regulations that penalize the peaceful expression of white racial consciousness and identity; and the abolition of all multicul-turalist curricula, ""sensitivity training,"" and similar experiments in brainwashing in schools, universities, businesses, and government. At the same time whites must seek to rebuild their own institutions—schools, businesses, churches, media, etc.—in which their own heritage and identity as whites can be preserved, honored, and transmitted to their descendants, and they must encourage measures that will help raise their own birth rates to at least replacement levels. Even these policies, however, would pit racially conscious whites against the dominant elites that continue to demand white racial dispossession and their non-white allies. Moreover, none of these measures will be adopted unless and until white racial consciousness is far more developed than it is today. Neither conventional conservative nor liberal ideologues show any serious interest in these particular measures or the racial identity they reflect, nor do either of the major political parties.</p>
<p>Whatever the precise political form that a resurrected white racial consciousness might take, the future of whites without such a binding and animating identity looks bleak. Already whites are finding themselves denied admission to major universities and access to important upward career paths because of ""affirmative action,"" a euphemism that masks the explicitly anti-white impact of such policies. The most obvious symbols and icons of the racially incorrect white past—those of the American South—have been demonized and largely removed from public display, often with the cooperation or even at the instigation of white leaders themselves. But the attack on white culture is by no means confined to the Confederate flag and Southern symbols. Presidents such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and even such liberal icons as Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson have all come under non-white attack for their racial beliefs and practices, as have the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Columbus Day are also denounced as commemorations of white repression, exploitation, and genocide of Indians and other non-whites, while Martin Luther King Day imports into our official national hagiography not only anon-white figure but King's entire ideology and agenda of white guilt and racial revolution. Non-white and non-Western holidays (Ramadan, Kwanzaa, Cinco de Mayo) are now observed in schools and by businesses and some local governments and national leaders (including President George W. Bush). In San Jose, California, a proposal to construct a public statue to Col. Thomas Fallon, who captured the city for the Americans in the Mexican-American War, was rejected, and a proposal to build a statue to the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl approved instead. Mexican-Americans at a soccer match in Los Angeles in 1998 booed and jeered the playing of the American national anthem before the game. The names of streets and bridges that commemorate white leaders are changed to honor nonwhites. ""Hate crimes"" against non-whites such as the brutal murder of a black man in Jasper, Texas, in 1998 by three white ex-convicts are national front page news for weeks, and national leaders descend upon the local community to show their solidarity with the victim and work to extirpate the institutionalized ""hate"" that supposedly caused the crime, while more federal laws against ""hate crimes"" are demanded. Yet even more brutal massacres of whites, like the rape, torture, kidnapping, and murder of four white men and women by two black criminals in Wichita, Kansas, in 2000, are seldom mentioned in the national news and excite no commentary whatsoever. O. J. Simpson, despite overwhelming evidence of his guilt in the murders of his white ex-wife and her friend, is acquitted by a racially mixed jury in which black jurors reject incriminating evidence as ""racist,"" while the verdict is celebrated nationwide by blacks. Does anyone seriously believe that whites in a nation where they have become a numerical minority and are denied the racial consciousness that makes political mobilization and resistance possible could be secure in their own liberty, rights, and physical safety, let alone certain of the survival of their civilization? Whites even today, while they remain a majority, are facing unprecedented physical and political threats that a strong common consciousness would halt and, only a few years ago, would have made impossible.</p>
<p>Is there a realistic chance that whites will develop a common racial consciousness before they are swallowed by the rising tide of nonwhites? It is perhaps significant that Shelby Steele wrote that whites today ""cannot <em>openly</em> have a racial identity."" He perhaps knows or suspects that there persists a powerful hidden white racial identity. If white racial consciousness is forbidden and does not exist, there is certainly a powerful racial subconscious among whites, as evidenced by patterns of school attendance, housing, church membership, marriage, and even voting. The ""color blindness"" about which conservatives like to chirp does not exist wherever whites (or other races) are free to choose their own associations. Whites, of course, will often avoid explaining or defending their preferences for association with their own race in racial terms. They move to the suburbs because tax rates and crime rates are lower; they send their children to mainly white schools because these schools are better; they attend the churches they do because those are the churches of their parents and their friends. But all such explanations— lower taxes and less crime, better schools, the habits of one's parents and friends—have obvious racial dimensions and correlations. A recent study by the Harvard Civil Rights Project, the <em>Washington Post</em> reports, shows that today ""schools are almost as segregated as they were when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated."" The segregation is due not to legally enforced discrimination but to the voluntary residence and attendance preferences of whites, who simply abandon communities and schools when non-whites arrive.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn6"" id=""ffn6"">[6]</a></sup> For much the same reason, Christian churches also remain racially exclusive. ""Just 8 percent of Christian churches in the United States are multiracial, defined as one ethnic group making up no more than 80 percent of the membership, according to a 2002 study.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn7"" id=""ffn7"">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Voting behavior shows the same racial patterns. In 2000, 54 percent of whites voted for the Republican candidate, George W. Bush, while only 42 percent voted for Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat. Bush received only 8 percent of the black vote and some 31 percent of Hispanic votes, while Gore won 90 percent of blacks and 67 percent of Hispanics. Nearly 20 percent of Gore's total vote came from blacks. No Democratic presidential candidate has won a majority of the white vote since 1968, at the latest.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn8"" id=""ffn8"">[8]</a></sup> In the 2004 election, Bush won even more of the white vote (58 percent), while receiving only a modest 3 percent increase in black support (to 11 percent) and (by some accounts) 44 percent of the Hispanic vote (though even according to these exit polls, a solid 56 percent majority of Hispanics supported Bush's Democratic opponent in 2004). A majority of Asian voters also supported the Democratic ticket in both 2000 (54 percent) and 2004 (58 percent).<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn9"" id=""ffn9"">[9]</a></sup> Just as whites separate themselves in neighborhoods, schools, and churches according to race, so they separate themselves by race in the parties, candidates, and (presumably) political ideologies they support.</p>
<p>Moreover, as non-white immigrants occupy more and more of the national territory, ""white flight"" extends not just from city to suburb and suburb to countryside but from region to region. As University of Michigan demographer William H. Frey and reporter Jonathan Tilove wrote in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> (August 20, 1995):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every immigrant who arrives [in large metropolitan areas], a white person leaves. Look collectively at the New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Boston metropolitan areas—5 of the top 11 immigration destinations. In the last half of the 80's, for every 10 immigrants who arrived, 9 residents left for points elsewhere. And most of those leaving were non-Hispanic whites.... The places that whites were leaving for were metro areas like Tampa-St. Petersburg, Seattle, Phoenix, Atlanta and Las Vegas, all of which attract relatively few immigrants.</p>
<p>The trend constitutes a new, larger form of white flight. Unlike in the old version, whites this time are not just fleeing the cities for the suburbs. They are leaving entire metropolitan areas and states—whole regions—for white destinations. And new census estimates indicate that this pattern of flight from big immigration destinations has become even more pronounced in the 90's.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, in marriages, the most vital relationship of all for the survival of a race, the overwhelming fact, despite constant acclamation by racial liberals of increases in interracial unions, is that whites continue to marry outside their own race less than any other race, and they do so in negligible numbers. The 2000 Census reports that only 3.5 percent of whites marry non-whites. Given the ending of legal barriers to interracial marriages nearly forty years ago and the immense increase of the nation's non-white population since that time, this persistent preference of whites for marriage partners of their own race is strong evidence of their enduring racial identity as whites.</p>
<p>The clear existence of a white racial subconscious means that the problem for whites is mainly to bring what it contains into consciousness, that what the advocates of a revived and reinvigorated racial consciousness must work for is analogous to what Freudian psychoanalysts claim to be doing in treating neurotics—to bring what has been repressed into consciousness. Whites today are indeed neurotic, because such a major part of their nature has been denied and repressed so long. They need to learn that race, as much as sex, is part of human nature and the human condition, that it can no more be expelled or denied or excluded than any other important fact or force of nature. As with every other such fact and force, human beings need to construct their social and political arrangements with nature in mind, and not build on fantasies that ignore or deny nature. Whites need to learn also that racial consciousness is no more a license for repression, exploitation, hatred, and violence than recognition of the reality and importance of sex is a license for rape, seduction, and debauchery. Obviously there are criminal and pathological elements that will use sex and race for criminal and pathological ends, but their existence does nothing to diminish the legitimacy and urgency of what those who demand their recognition for healthy purposes are seeking.</p>
<p>Finally, whites need to form their racial consciousness in conformity not only with what we now know about the scientific reality of race but also with the moral and political traditions of Western Man—White Man. The purpose of white racial consciousness and identity is not simply to serve as a balance against the aggression and domination of other races but also to preserve, protect, and help revitalize the legacy of the civilization that our own ancestors created and handed down to us, for its own sake, because it is ours, and because, by the standards of the values and ideals we as a race and a civilization have articulated, it is better. After generations of denial and distortion, what we have permitted to be expelled and repressed now returns, and we now know again, as our ancestors once knew also, that in the absence of the race that created that legacy, it would never have existed at all. If the legacy is to pass on to our own descendants, it will be because we as white men and women understood who we were, what it was we created, how it came to exist, and how it will endure. The essays collected here are a first step toward that goal.</p>

<meta content=""Racial differences in intelligence, personality, and behavior have been 
discussed since ancient times. In the second century A.D. the Greek 
physician Galen wrote that black Africans are less intelligent than 
Europeans. In the Middle Ages a number of Persian and Arabic writers took 
the same view, and in the thirteenth century the Persian geographer Nasir 
al-Din Tusi went to far as to assert that black Africans were less 
intelligent than apes. The first to attempt to quantify race differences in 
intelligence was Sir Francis Galton in his *Hereditary Genius* (1869). He 
estimated the intelligence of several populations from the numbers of 
intelligent individuals as a proportion of the population. He concluded 
that the Greeks of the classical period were the most highly intelligent 
people that have ever appeared and that the lowland Scots were slightly 
more intelligent than the English. He considered sub-Saharan Africans to be 
much less intelligent and the Australian Aborigines the least intelligent 
race. Galton did not make any estimate of the intelligence of the American 
Indians or Orientals. However, he considered the Chinese a highly 
intelligent people. In a letter published in *The Times* in 1873 he wrote 
that &quot;The Chinaman is endowed with a remarkable aptitude for a high 
material civilization. He is seen to the least advantage in his own 
country, where a temporary dark age still prevails, which has not sapped 
the genius of the race though it has stunted the development of each member 
of it by a rigid enforcement of an effete system of classical education 
which treats originality as a crime.&quot; Galton's estimates are quite close to 
those obtained in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries from 
intelligence tests."" property=""og:description""/>

physician Galen wrote that black Africans are less intelligent than 
Europeans. In the Middle Ages a number of Persian and Arabic writers took 
the same view, and in the thirteenth century the Persian geographer Nasir 
al-Din Tusi went to far as to assert that black Africans were less 
intelligent than apes. The first to attempt to quantify race differences in 
intelligence was Sir Francis Galton in his *Hereditary Genius* (1869). He 
estimated the intelligence of several populations from the numbers of 
intelligent individuals as a proportion of the population. He concluded 
that the Greeks of the classical period were the most highly intelligent 
people that have ever appeared and that the lowland Scots were slightly 
more intelligent than the English. He considered sub-Saharan Africans to be 
much less intelligent and the Australian Aborigines the least intelligent 
race. Galton did not make any estimate of the intelligence of the American 
Indians or Orientals. However, he considered the Chinese a highly 
intelligent people. In a letter published in *The Times* in 1873 he wrote 
that &quot;The Chinaman is endowed with a remarkable aptitude for a high 
material civilization. He is seen to the least advantage in his own 
country, where a temporary dark age still prevails, which has not sapped 
the genius of the race though it has stunted the development of each member 
of it by a rigid enforcement of an effete system of classical education 
which treats originality as a crime.&quot; Galton's estimates are quite close to 
those obtained in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries from 
intelligence tests."" itemprop=""description""/>

In the second century A.D. the Greek physician Galen wrote that black Africans are less intelligent than Europeans. In the Middle Ages a number of Persian and Arabic writers took the same view, and in the thirteenth century the Persian geographer Nasir al-Din Tusi went to far as to assert that black Africans were less intelligent than apes. The first to attempt to quantify race differences in intelligence was Sir Francis Galton in his <em>Hereditary Genius</em> (1869). He estimated the intelligence of several populations from the numbers of intelligent individuals as a proportion of the population. He concluded that the Greeks of the classical period were the most highly intelligent people that have ever appeared and that the lowland Scots were slightly more intelligent than the English. He considered sub-Saharan Africans to be much less intelligent and the Australian Aborigines the least intelligent race. Galton did not make any estimate of the intelligence of the American Indians or Orientals. However, he considered the Chinese a highly intelligent people. In a letter published in <em>The Times</em> in 1873 he wrote that ""The Chinaman is endowed with a remarkable aptitude for a high material civilization. He is seen to the least advantage in his own country, where a temporary dark age still prevails, which has not sapped the genius of the race though it has stunted the development of each member of it by a rigid enforcement of an effete system of classical education which treats originality as a crime."" Galton's estimates are quite close to those obtained in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries from intelligence tests.</p>
<h2 id=""racedifferencesinintelligence"">Race Differences in Intelligence</h2>
<p>The first intelligence test was devised in France by Alfred Binet in 1905. This served as a model for a number of tests that were constructed from the 1910s onward in the United States, Britain, and other economically developed nations. From the 1920s numerous investigators administered tests to samples of races throughout most of the world, and a considerable amount of evidence has accumulated on their average IQs. The results of these studies are summarized in the table. The IQs are based on an IQ of 100 for British and American Europeans. These IQs are averages obtained from several hundred studies.</p></div></div><div class=""sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code"" data-block-type=""23"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_30_1421031014931_12090""><div class=""sqs-block-content""><style type=""text/css"">

About the same IQ is obtained from ethnic Orientals in the United States. The high IQ of Orientals is manifested in their considerable educational attainments in math and science. In the United States they have higher average educational qualifications and earnings than Europeans and are over-represented in elite colleges and in the professions. Because they do so well and have low rates of crime, they have become known as the ""model minority"" and are excluded from the affirmative action programs that give preferential treatment to blacks and Hispanics in admission to colleges and employment.</p><p>It is a puzzle that despite the high IQ of Oriental peoples, it was the European peoples who pioneered the industrial revolution and made virtually all the intellectual advances in science, mathematics, and technology during the last five hundred years or so. Viewed over a longer historical period, this anomaly is less of a problem. From around 1500 B.C. to around A.D. 1500, the Chinese, who are the great majority of Orientals, have been either as advanced as or more advanced than Europeans. About 1500-1100 B.C., at a time when Europeans were still living in villages on subsistence agriculture, the Shang dynasty was developed on the Hwang (Yellow) river. This early civilization was sustained by domesticated millet, rice, pigs, cattle, sheep, water buffalo, and chickens. It had towns with substantial buildings, bronze utensils, and glazed pottery turned on the wheel. It used cowry shells for money and devised a written language that formed the basis of the later Chinese characters. In 202 B.C. the Han dynasty was established as an extensive empire covering contemporary China and Korea and had a population of about sixty million. The capital city at Changan had a perimeter of approximately 25 kilometers and contained a number of pavilions as high as 115 meters. The empire contained numerous cities linked by roads and canals, and the Great Wall was built. Manufactures included iron ploughs, cooking stoves, tools and weapons, silk, carts, and ships. To administer this empire, the Chinese established the system of appointing mandarins as officials to administer the provinces. To ensure that these officials were men of high ability, a system of competitive written examinations was introduced to recruit an intellectual elite for the mandarin class.</p><p>The Han dynasty lasted until A.D. 220, but there was no dark age in China such as descended on Europe with the fall of Rome in 476 and the closure of the school in Athens in 529, after which the learning of Greece and Rome was largely lost in Western Europe. After these calamities in Europe, for a period of around a thousand years from the sixth to the sixteenth century A.D., civilization in China was more advanced than in Europe. ""A thousand years ago, the Chinese were well ahead of anyone else—and certainly of Europe,"" writes the historian David Landes. When Marco Polo visited China about the year 1300, he was amazed at the quality of civilization in the numerous prosperous cities and particularly by the use of paper money, a concept not introduced into Europe until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Among the important inventions and discoveries made by the Chinese during this period, well before they were invented in Europe, were printing; mills driven by water for shaking and sifting flour; an extensive series of canals with locks, principally running north-south and linking the Huang Ho and Yangtze rivers; the suspension bridge supported with iron chains; the stirrup; the formula for making gunpowder, which was used to produce rockets, bombs, and small firearms shooting bullets from bamboo and metal tubes and to fire cannon; the magnetic compass for navigation at sea; methane gas for lighting; the spinning wheel; the water-powered mechanical clock; and the manufacture of porcelain.</p><p>The reasons why Chinese science, technology, and mathematics petered out and the lead passed to Europe from about the year 1500 onwards are difficult to explain. As the historian Hugh Thomas has written, ""The failure by the Chinese to exploit their great advantages ...will remain one of the great problems of history."" There were three factors that must have made significant contributions to the decline of China and the rise of Europe. The first was that for some fifteen hundred years the curriculum for the examinations for the mandarinate comprised astronomy, mathematics, Chinese literature, and Chinese history. In the early fourteenth century the mandarins responsible for the curriculum decided to drop astronomy and mathematics and confine it to Chinese literature and history. This had two effects. One was that from this time onwards the mandarinate consisted of men with literary interests and abilities who had no knowledge of astronomy and mathematics or of science generally, or interest in promoting it. A second was that the Chinese schools that prepared students for the examinations for the mandarinate stopped teaching astronomy and mathematics and ceased to be centers for teaching and research in these fields, with the result that knowledge of them largely came to an end. A further factor that contributed to China's economic, cultural, and intellectual stagnation was that China was a unitary authoritarian state whose rulers frequently opposed economic and intellectual progress and were able to prevent its development.</p><h3 id=""europeans"">Europeans</h3><p>The European peoples in Europe, North and South America, Australia, and New Zealand have an average IQ of 97. The IQ of Europeans is highest in north and west Europe, including Italy and Spain, where it is about 100, and falls off to around 95 in east and southeast Europe. The reason for this is probably that east and southeast Europe have been impoverished by communism, which has had an adverse environmental impact on the intelligence of peoples because of poor nutrition. Several explanations have been proposed for the problem that from around the year 1500, Europeans made virtually all the important discoveries in economic development, science, mathematics, and technology. One factor was that from the thirteenth century onwards numerous universities were founded in Europe. In addition to literature and theology, these taught astronomy, mathematics, and also medicine, which gave students a grounding in chemistry. These universities provided a basic education for numerous generations of students and provided professorships for many of the leading scholars who made advances in astronomy, mathematics, and science. Copernicus entered the University of Cracow in 1491, where he studied mathematics and optics; Galileo studied mathematics at the University of Pisa in the 1580s and was later appointed professor at this and other Italian universities; Kepler studied mathematics at the University of Tubingen in the 1580s and was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Graz in 1593; in 1661 Isaac Newton entered Cambridge University, where he studied mathematics and was appointed professor of mathematics in 1669.</p><p>A second significant factor accounting for the advances in science, technology, and mathematics in Europe was that Europe consisted of a large number of independent nation states. The diversity of states in Europe meant that if science was discouraged in some, it was able to flourish in others. For instance, in Spain the Roman Catholic Church was unsympathetic to scientific inquiry, with the result that Spain made very little contribution to scientific and mathematical developments. But there were plenty of other countries in Europe where scientific and mathematical advances were able to take place. A further effect of the numerous independent nations in Europe was that these were constantly at war with one another, whereas China generally consisted of a single state and was less frequently involved in warfare. The rulers of the European states were keen to buy new scientific and technological military products to prosecute their wars more effectively. This provided a market for the development of new military technologies, a number of which were developed by army and naval officers. For instance, the mirror sextant for navigation at sea was invented by the Scottish naval officer John Campbell in 1737, and the breechloading rifle was invented in 1776 by the British army officer Patrick Ferguson. In 1714 the British government offered a prize of £20,000 for the invention of an instrument that would give an accurate measure of a ship's longitude at sea, a prize won by John Harrison.</p><p>A number of military inventions had more general applications beyond their military use. For instance, the principle of the cannon, which was developed in Europe for warfare on land and sea, is similar to that of the piston-operated steam engine invented by the English engineer Thomas Newcomen in 1712 and to the later internal combustion engine, in so far as both involve an explosion propelling a solid object through a tube. From the sixteenth century onwards, a significant number of the scientific and technological advances in Europe and, later, in the United States, were motivated and financed for military purposes, culminating in the government-funded atomic power and space research programs of the second half of the twentieth century.</p><h3 id=""americanindians"">American Indians</h3><p>The IQ of American Indians in both North and South America is 92. This may seem high considering the generally poor social and economic performance of these peoples. This is largely because in the United States and Canada many of them live on reservations where they have become welfare dependent with high rates of unemployment, alcoholism, and other drug addictions. In South America many of them have become enervated by their dependence on cocaine obtained by chewing the leaves of the coca plant. The demoralized state of many of these peoples today makes it difficult to believe that their ancestors built the empires of the Incas, Mayas, and Aztecs. The intelligence test results tell us that they were sufficiently intelligent to have accomplished this, but many of them seem to have personality problems that make them unable to compete in societies dominated by Europeans.</p><h3 id=""southeastasians"">Southeast Asians</h3><p>The Southeast Asians are the peoples of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Borneo. Their average IQ is 87. Their intelligence is a little higher than that of the South Asians (IQ 82) because they have some genetic admixture from Oriental peoples from China. Civilizations were developed in Southeast Asia from around 250 B.C. (Scarr, 1995). The first walled town in Southeast Asia was built about this time at Co Loa in present-day Vietnam and the ruins of a number of its stone buildings survive. The city state of Peithano developed in the first five centuries A.D. in present-day Burma. The city was surrounded by a brick wall and comprised an area of approximately 800 hectares. The period from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries A.D. saw the establishment of several extensive civilizations. The most highly developed was the Khmer empire based in present-day Cambodia, which extended some thousand miles from east to west from present-day Vietnam through to southern Thailand and Burma. Its capital was the city of Angkor, founded in the year 802. In the next two centuries it grew to a size of approximately eight square kilometers and had an estimated population of between 80,000 and 150,000. From the year 1000 it grew further to a size of approximately 250,000 square kilometers and a population of around one million. The city contained numerous substantial stone buildings, and the civilization had a written language, metal working for making armor, agricultural implements, tools, and other artifacts, and it used money. Its capital Angkor was attacked and sacked by an army from Thailand in the year 1431. The emperor and the survivors abandoned the city and established a new capital farther south. A large number of substantial stone buildings and temples with elaborate carvings depicting Khmer soldiers wearing armor, markets, fishing, and cock fighting survive to this day. Much of the written language of the Khmer civilization survives on inscriptions on the stone buildings.</p><h3 id=""pacificislanders"">Pacific Islanders</h3><p>The Pacific Islanders are the indigenous peoples of the numerous Pacific islands, the principal of which are New Zealand, the groups of islands of Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia, and Hawaii, and the isolated Easter Island. These islands were uninhabited by humans until about 1500-1000 B.C., when Micronesia, Melanesia, and western Polynesia began to be settled by Southeast Asian peoples from Indonesia. It was not until about A.D. 650 that all the major islands of Polynesia were settled. The last of the Pacific islands to be colonized was New Zealand, which was settled about A.D. 850 by Polynesians who were the ancestors of the contemporary Maoris. Numerically, the Pacific Islanders are one of the minor races, numbering about 1.5 million.</p><p>The Pacific Islanders' IQ of 85 is very close to that of the Southeast Asians, (87) from whom they originated and to whom they are closely related. In New Zealand the Maoris have lower educational attainment than white New Zealanders. In the 1991 census 79 percent of them had no high school or other educational qualifications compared with 61 percent of Europeans. The cultural achievements of the Pacific Islanders were not so advanced as those of the Southeast Asians. When they were discovered by Europeans, none of them had made the full transition from hunter-gatherers to settled agriculture supporting substantial towns, and they had no written language or numbers. However, many of the islanders, including the Maoris, were cultivating the taro, yam, and sweet potato. Their boat construction and navigation, which enabled them to cross thousands of miles of ocean, were impressive. Probably the reason the Pacific Islanders did not make the same advances toward civilization as the Southeast Asians is that they were isolated as small populations, typically of a few thousand on widely dispersed islands, and were not sufficiently numerous to make substantial technological, scientific, and cultural progress.</p><h3 id=""southasiansandnorthafricans"">South Asians and North Africans</h3><p>The South Asians are the peoples of Bangladesh in the east through India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, the Gulf states, the Near East, and Turkey. They are closely related to the Europeans and some of the classical anthropologists have combined them with Europeans as Caucasoids. However, their average IQ of 84 is much lower than that of Europeans, and they are best treated as a separate race. These peoples built some of the earliest civilizations in Sumeria in present-day Iraq, in Egypt, and in the Indus valley, but from around the year 500 B.C. their achievements have been unimpressive. It is true that from around A.D. 750 through A.D. 1200 the South Asians established a large empire that stretched from the Indus valley through North Africa to Spain, with its capital city in Baghdad. During this time they produced a number of scholars, but none of the first rank, and they were largely custodians of the intellectual advances made by the Greeks in the period between approximately 500 B.C. to A.D. 500. Nor did they produce any major scientific or technological discoveries or any great works of literature, except perhaps the <em>Thousand and One Nights</em>.</p><p>The North Africans have the same IQ of 84 as the South Asians. This is to be expected as they are very closely related genetically. Like the South Asians, they built one of the most impressive early civilizations, in Egypt, but they have achieved little during the last three thousand years.</p><p>It may seem anomalous that the South Asians and North Africans, who have quite low IQs, should have built the first civilizations at a time when the Europeans and Japanese, who have higher IQs today, were still living as hunter-gatherers. The explanation for this is that the first civilizations were developed along the river valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus, the Nile, and the Hwang (Yellow) river. These had extensive flood plains on which fertile alluvial deposits were left each year on which agricultural surpluses could be produced for the towns in which the civilizations developed. The first civilization that was built without this advantage was developed by Europeans in Crete. At the time these early civilizations were built, Europe and Japan were covered with forests that made it impossible to grow the agricultural surpluses capable of supporting towns.</p><h3 id=""subsaharanafricans"">Sub-Saharan Africans</h3><p>The sub-Saharan Africans in Africa have an average IQ of about 70 and, in the Caribbean, an average IQ of about 72, while Afro-Americans (blacks) in the United States have an average IQ of 85. There are two reasons why the IQ of Afro-Americans is higher than that of Africans in sub-Saharan Africa. The first is that Afro-Americans have an admixture of about 25 percent of European genes, which increases their IQs. Afro-Americans with more European ancestry and lighter skins have higher IQs than those with darker skins. The second reason that the IQ of Afro-Americans is higher than that of sub-Saharan Africans is that they live in an affluent society run by Europeans that provides them with good nutrition, education, standard of living, and other environmental advantages.</p><p>The low IQ of sub-Saharan Africans is consistent with their failure to make any of the advances of civilization. When Europeans began to explore sub-Saharan Africa from the late eighteenth century onwards, they found that the peoples were in a transitional stage between hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies. None of these peoples had devised a written language or numbers. African languages are simple and lack complex abstract nouns. Typically there are words for only a few colors such as red, white, and black, but no words for subtle shades of color. The arithmetical systems typically have words for one and two, while larger numbers are expressed as ""many."" No sub-Saharan Africans have made any significant discoveries in science, mathematics, or technology.</p><p>When first described by European explorers like Mungo Park and John Speke in the early nineteenth century, many Africans in West Africa were living in villages, and there were some towns with a few thousand inhabitants. There was farming of rice, sorghum, and pearl millet, and the guinea fowl had been domesticated. Iron was smelted in equatorial Africa about 500 B.C. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries some good quality bronzes were made in Benin. It is generally considered that this technology came originally from the Arabs, who introduced it into the Sudan, from which it was transported to West Africa. The problem of whether the low IQ of sub-Saharan Africans has a genetic basis has been discussed since the 1920s. The definitive study to resolve this issue was carried out in the United States by Sandra Scarr at Yale in the 1970s and 1980s. She examined the IQs of black infants in Minnesota and other northern states adopted by white middle-class couples. Her expectation was that they would have much higher IQs, but she found that at the age of seventeen and eighteen their IQs were just the same as those of other blacks in the northern states (which are a little higher than those of blacks in the south, because it was the more intelligent blacks who migrated north after the abolition of slavery). This was a disappointing result for Scarr, who had said that if she ever came to the conclusion that there was a genetic basis for the low black IQ, she would emigrate from the United States. Her result convinced her that the low black IQ must have a genetic basis. She has yet to buy her one-way ticket, but she has done the next best thing by retiring from academic life and moving to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p><h3 id=""australianaborigines"">Australian Aborigines</h3><p>The Australian Aborigines are the least intelligent of the races, with an average IQ of 62. Their low intelligence was evident to the Europeans who discovered Australia in the late eighteenth century and found the Aborigines living as hunter-gatherers in a stone age without pottery, agriculture, or metals. They did not plant seeds to grow food or keep herds of animals. Their stone implements were the axe, knife, and small flakes mounted as barbs of spearheads. Their weapons consisted of clubs, spears, spear throwers, and throwing sticks, including the boomerang. They never invented the bow and arrow. Women used digging sticks to uproot yams and other roots. They never domesticated the dingo, the wild dog of Australia. They had no written language or numerals. Their languages were lacking in abstract concepts and had few collective nouns, indicative of an inability to formulate general concepts that is one of the principal characteristics of intelligence. Their languages had numbers only for one and two. Consistent with their low IQ, the Australian Aborigines have poor educational attainment and high rates of unemployment, crime, and drug addiction and are poorly integrated into European Australia. A genetic basis of the low intelligence of the Australian Aborigines is suggested by studies showing that mixed-race Aborigines and Europeans have higher IQs than pure Aborigines, and by a small study of Aboriginal children adopted by Europeans that found that their IQs were lower than those of Europeans.</p><h2 id=""racedifferencesinpersonalityandbehavior"">Race Differences in Personality and Behavior</h2><p>Over the centuries a recurring theme in the European and Arabian descriptions of the personality and behavioral characteristics of black Africans has been that they are impulsive, intolerant of sustained work effort, live for the present, and have poor self-control. Lewis has summarized the views of a number of classical Arab writers such as the eleventh-century historians and geographers Said al-Andalusi of Toledo, who wrote that blacks lacked ""self-control and steadiness of mind,” and Maqdisi, who described black Africans as having the nature of ""wild animals.” Europeans who explored Africa in the nineteenth century reached similar conclusions. John Speke, who traveled extensively in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda between 1857 and 1862, wrote of Africans that ""laziness is inherent in these men...they are a loose, roving, reckless set of beings...economy, care or foresight never enters his head...he is a creature of impulse—a grown child.” Francis Galton, who made an expedition to Angola in 1850, wrote of ""the lazy Negro.” Similar observations were made about blacks in the Caribbean.</p><p>Anthony Trollope visited a number of islands in 1858 and subsequently wrote up his impressions in his book <em>The West Indies and the Spanish Main</em>. He described Jamaica in the most detail and wrote of the typical black that ""he is idle, unambitious as to worldly position, sensual, and content with little.”</p><h3 id=""psychopathicpersonality"">Psychopathic Personality</h3><p>These characteristics of blacks as they have been perceived histori-cally can now be understood as arising from a high level of psychopathic personality. The concept of psychopathic personality was identified in the early nineteenth century by the British physician John Pritchard, who proposed the term ""moral imbecility"" for those deficient in moral sense but whose intellectual ability was unimpaired. The term psychopathic personality was proposed in 1915 by the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin. Harvey Cleckley described psychopathic personality in what has become a classic work, <em>The Mask of Sanity</em> (1941). He listed the principal expressions of the condition as being shallow emotions, defective insight, absence of nervousness, lack of remorse or shame, superficial charm, pathological lying, egocentricity and inability to love, failure to establish close or intimate relationships, irresponsibility, impulsive antisocial acts, failure to learn from experience, reckless behavior under the influence of alcohol, and a lack of long-term goals. In 1984 the American Psychiatric Association dropped the term psycho-pathic personality and replaced it with ""antisocial personality disorder""; this is simply a synonym for psychopathic personality. </p><p>The features of antisocial personality disorder set out by the American Psychiatric Association are (1) inability to sustain consistent work behavior; (2) failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior (i.e. crime); (3) irritability and aggression, as indicated by frequent physical fights and assaults; (4) repeated failure to honor financial obligations; (5) failure to plan ahead or impulsivity; (6) no regard for truth, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or ""conning"" others; (7) recklessness regarding one's own or others' personal safety, as indicated by driving while intoxicated or recurrent speeding; (8) inability to function as a responsible parent; (9) failure to sustain a monogamous relationship for more than one year; (10) lack of remorse; and (11) the presence of conduct disorder in childhood.</p><p>Psychopathic personality is an extreme manifestation of a continuously distributed personality trait. There are race differences in the distribution of the trait such that psychopathic personality is high among blacks and American Indians, somewhat lower in Hispanics, lower still in Europeans and South Asians, and lowest in Orientals. Psychopathic personality appears to be high in Australian Aborigines, among whom it is expressed in high rates of unemployment, crime, truancy from school, and drug addiction. Little is known about the level of psychopathic personality in Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders.</p><h3 id=""inabilitytosustainconsistentworkbehavior"">Inability to Sustain Consistent Work Behavior</h3><p>Race differences in ""inability to sustain consistent work behavior” are manifested in differences in rates of unemployment. In the United States, unemployment is highest among blacks and American Indians, lower among Hispanics, lower still among Europeans, and lowest among Orientals. These differences are often attributed to ""white racism,” but several American sociologists have concluded that a major reason for the high rate of unemployment among blacks in inner cities is an unwillingness to work. Thus, E. Anderson has written that ""there are many unemployed black youth who are unmotivated and uninterested in working for a living, particularly in the dead-end jobs they are likely to get.” Similarly, S.M. Petterson has written that ""it is commonly contended that young black men experience more joblessness than their white counterparts because they are less willing to seek out low paying jobs.” These race differences are also present in Britain, Canada, and France. In Britain, 26 percent of black men were found to be unemployed in the 1991 census, compared with 11 percent of whites and Chinese. In Canada, 13 percent of black men were found to be unemployed in the 1991 census, compared with 7 percent of whites. In France in 1994, 11 percent of black men were found to be unemployed, compared with 8 percent of whites. Race differences in work motivation also appear in the amount of homework done by school students. Several studies in the United States have found that Orientals do the most homework, blacks and American Indians the least, with whites and Hispanics intermediate.</p><h3 id=""crime"">Crime</h3><p>Rates for nonviolent crime such as burglary and car theft in the United States are about four times higher for blacks than whites. The rate for Hispanics and American Indians is about three times greater, while the rate for Orientals is lower, at about 80 percent of the white rate. In England the imprisonment rate for blacks is about six times greater than that for whites, while the rate for South Asians is about the same as that of whites. In Canada the imprisonment rate for blacks is about five times greater than that for whites, and, for American Indians, about two and a half times that of whites, while the rate for Orientals is about half that for whites, and for South Asians about two-thirds that of whites. In France the imprisonment rate for blacks is about eight times greater than that for whites, while in Sweden imprisonment for blacks is about two and a half times greater than that for whites and Orientals.</p><h3 id=""irritabilityandaggression"">Irritability and Aggression</h3><p>Race differences are present in a number of kinds of aggressive behavior. Homicide rates in the United States for black men are about six times greater than for whites, and for American Indian men about three times greater than for whites. Homicide rates for black and American Indian females are about four times greater than for whites. But the American ethnic Oriental homicide rate is only 60 percent the rate of whites. The same black-white differences are present in South Africa, but Indians in South Africa, originally from the Indian subcontinent, have approximately the same rate as whites.</p><p>Similar differences appear in convictions for assault and robbery, which in the United States are about twelve times greater for blacks, about three times greater for Hispanics, and twice as great for American Indians than for whites. The rates for Orientals are about 80 percent those of whites. Convictions for rape show the same differences. These are about five and a half times greater for blacks than for whites and about two to three times greater for Hispanics and American Indians, as compared with whites, while among Orientals rape is about half the rate for whites.</p><p>Domestic violence shows the same differences. The rate of severe violence by husbands toward their wives is about four times as frequent among blacks and American Indians as compared with whites, while assaults by wives on husbands are about twice as common for blacks and American Indians as for whites.</p><h3 id=""honoringfinancialobligations"">Honoring Financial Obligations</h3><p>The APA lists ""persistent failure to honor financial obligations"" among the characteristics of psychopathic personality. An index of this characteristic is available in the default rates on student loans. About half of American students at colleges and universities take out loans that they are required to repay after graduation. Not all graduates repay these loans. Racial differences in loan default rates have been calculated from the data of the 1987 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study of 6,338 graduates. The percentages of loan defaulters for the four major American racial and ethnic groups were as follows: blacks: 55 percent; American Indians: 45 percent; Hispanics: 20 percent; and whites: 5 percent. The same differences are present for credit ratings made on the basis of records of the nonpayment of debts, unacceptably late payments, and bankruptcy. A report by the American agency, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), on 12,000 households in 1999 found the highest percentage of poor credit ratings among blacks (48 percent) and the next highest among Hispanics (34 percent), while whites had the lowest percentage of poor credit ratings (27 percent).</p><h3 id=""failuretoplanahead"">Failure to Plan Ahead</h3><p>The ""failure to plan ahead"" component of psychopathic personality includes an inability or unwillingness to delay immediate gratification for along-term advantage. The first study to demonstrate differences between blacks and whites in the delay of gratification was carried out in the late 1950s in Trinidad by the American psychologist Mischel. He offered black and white children the choice between being given a small candy bar now or a larger one in a week's time. He found that black children were much more likely to ask for the small candy now. This difference has been confirmed in three subsequent studies. This race difference has been noted but given different descriptions by several writers. For instance, Banfi eld writes of the ""extreme present-orientation"" of blacks, and Levin of their ""high time preference,"" an economists' term for preferring cash now to a greater sum, including accrued interest in the future.</p><h3 id=""recklessness"">Recklessness</h3><p>Race differences in recklessness find expression in various forms of behavior. In automobiles, for instance, fewer blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians wear seat belts than whites, but more Orientals wear seat belts. Blacks and American Indians have about twice as many automobile accidents as whites. The main factors responsible for accidents are heavy drinking and speeding.</p><p>Recklessness is also expressed in the failure of those who do not wish to have children to use contraception. Studies in the United States have shown that blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians are less likely than whites to use contraception. In Britain blacks use contraception less than whites and South Asians. The result of a lower use of contraception is that blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians have greater rates of teenage and unplanned pregnancies than whites and (in Britain) South Asians.</p><h3 id=""irresponsibleparenting"">Irresponsible Parenting</h3><p>Race differences in irresponsible parenting are expressed in the prevalence of child abuse, maltreatment, and neglect. In the United States the rates of these forms of irresponsible parenting are about twice as high for blacks as among whites, while the rate for Hispanics is about 50 percent higher than for whites. The most extreme expression of the inability to function as a responsible parent consists of killing a child. Blacks and American Indians are convicted of homicide of their infants at about four times the rate of whites, Hispanics at about the same rate, while Orientals kill their infants at about two-thirds the rate of whites.</p><h3 id=""monogamy"">Monogamy</h3><p>The psychopathic personality's incapacity for long-term monogamous relationships is expressed in its marital infidelity and its low rates of marriage and cohabitation. Two sociologists, Staples and Johnson, write that ""Blacks do not rank marriage as highly as whites” and that ""Black Americans' acceptance of this form of relationship is inconsistent with their African heritage.” In the United States in the early 1990s, 66 percent of adult Orientals were married, 61 percent of whites, 55 percent of Hispanics, 48 percent of American Indians, and 35 percent of blacks. In Britain and in France as well, Orientals are the most likely to be married, followed by South Asians and whites, while blacks have the lowest rate of marriage. The same differences have been found in the Caribbean, of which the sociologists Ram and Ebanks write, ""In the Caribbean in general...there is a substantial amount of movement from one sex partner to another and also a very high percentage of reproduction outside marriage.” Rates of marriage in the Caribbean are much lower among blacks than among South Asians and Chinese. When they do marry, surveys in the United States and Britain have found that blacks are less faithful to their spouses and have more sexual partners both inside and outside marriage than whites.</p><h3 id=""conductdisorder"">Conduct Disorder</h3><p>Conduct disorder in children and early adolescence is a frequent precursor of psychopathic behavior in adulthood. Conduct disorder consists of persistent disobedience, lying, stealing, burglary, truancy, vandalism, cruelty, and sexual precocity. In the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, conduct disorder is about twice as frequent among black children as among whites, but is less common among Orientals than among whites. Among young adolescents, conduct disorder is expressed as delinquency. In the United States delinquency (serious juvenile crime) is about ten times greater among black boys and about fourteen times greater among black girls, as compared with whites. Conduct disorders and delinquency are also expressed in suspensions and exclusions from schools because of constant misbehavior. In Britain, blacks are excluded from schools at about four times the rate of whites. In the United States blacks and American Indians are excluded from schools at about three times the rate of whites, and Hispanics at about the same rate, while Orientals are excluded at about half the rate of whites. There are also race differences in sexual precocity in early adolescence. For instance, in the United States a survey carried out in 1992 found that 33 percent of black thirteen-year-olds had had sexual intercourse as compared with 15 percent of Hispanics, 14 percent of whites, and 4 percent of Orientals. Similar differences have been found in Britain, where more blacks but fewer South Asian teenagers had had sex, as compared with whites.</p><h3 id=""consistency"">Consistency</h3><p>The pattern of the racial differences in the expressions of psychopathic personality shows a considerable degree of consistency. Blacks and American Indians invariably show higher levels of psychopathic personality than whites. Orientals invariably show lower levels of psychopathic personality than whites. South Asians in Britain and South Africa typically show about the same levels of psychopathic personality as whites. In the United States Hispanics are typically less psychopathic than blacks and American Indians but more psychopathic than whites.</p><h2 id=""evolutionofracedifferences"">Evolution of Race Differences</h2><p>Race differences have evolved as adaptations to different environments. For instance, peoples in the tropics have dark skins because these give protection against ultraviolet radiation that causes skin cancer, but Europeans and Orientals evolved pale skins because temperate and cold environments allow the synthesis of vitamin D from sunlight. Similar adaptations have evolved for intelligence and personality. It was more difficult to survive intemperate and cold environments than in the tropics because food was harder to obtain, and clothing and shelters had to be made, so Europeans and Orientals evolved higher intelligence to deal with these problems. They also evolved lower psychopathic personality. The problems of surviving during cold winters would have required stronger bonding between males and females with greater and longer-term commitment by males to provision their female mates and children, more responsible and concerned parenting, a greater sense of the importance of maintaining harmonious and cooperative relations within the group, and the development of stronger control over aggression towards other group members and other forms of antisocial behavior. All of the components of psychopathic personality would have been disadvantageous for survival during the cold winters of Eurasia and would have selected for a reduction of psychopathic personality in Europeans and Orientals.</p></div></div><div class=""sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule"" data-block-type=""47"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_1_1421031014931_298893""><div class=""sqs-block-content""><hr/></div></div><div class=""sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown"" data-block-type=""44"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_1_1421031014931_299022""><div class=""sqs-block-content""><h2 id=""bibliography"">Bibliography</h2>

<p>The mayhem that engulfed New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina has produced a peculiarly predictable pattern of analysis and commentary in the mass media, especially from the pundits and scribes that inhabit the conservative establishment. </p>
<p>What is missing from this conservative assessment is any sustained scrutiny of how race factored into the thuggish behavior that erupted in New Orleans. Survivors described a harrowing inhuman ordeal at the Superdome, which is home to the New Orleans Saints football team, but became eerily reminiscent of the teeming boatloads of Hindu interlopers who overrun France in Jean Raspail’s prophetic doomsday novel <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>. </p>
<p>What troubles, and disgusts, about the conservative response is its utter refusal to acknowledge the elephant in the room: the pachyderm-sized differences in behavior between black and white communities in the face of civic or civil disaster, and the violence that blacks unleash when law and order breakdown. The front-page coverage in the September 5 issue of <em>Human Events</em> typifies the reluctance of conservatives to address the issue. The headline in the conservative weekly, “Fix New Orleans, Then Drill for Oil” betrays the mindset of the <em>Human Events</em> editors: Focus exclusively on the nation’s “energy policy” and avoid any mention of the lawlessness—murder, rapes, assaults, pillaging and looting—that flourished in New Orleans, precisely because of the racial component of that widespread lawlessness. </p>
<p>The New Guinean expression <em>Mokita</em> (truth that is widely known but rarely spoken) captures the conservatives’ apprehension to discuss contemporary racial taboos. Certain truths are internalized— accepted as fact but not to be publicly mentioned. Rational minds know that the <em>type</em> of reaction to a natural disaster would differ vastly depending on the location (surrogate for population).
 Would disaster victims in Salt Lake City, Utah or Portland, Maine, loot, pillage, murder and rape their fellow residents in a Katrina-like tragedy? Or would these communities, rich and poor alike, pull together under extremely dire situations when all is lost but the determination to persevere and rebuild their neighborhoods from ground zero? Despite the reluctance to admit it, everyone knows there’s a difference and that race is a major factor which explains the difference. </p>
<p>Conservatives who refuse to confront underlying racial factors can more easily dwell upon politically correct prerequisites. Radical egalitarianism—the belief that there are no natural differences between human groups—reigns as supreme in the salons of the conservative establishment as it does elsewhere in society’s political and social elites. </p>
<p>The failure of conservatives to capture the cultural foundations of contemporary Western societies explains only part of it. The rise of political correctness and multiculturalism also play a major factor in making race and racial differences inappropriate topics for civil discussion. From the public schoolroom and university classroom to pop culture and the media to pulpits and pews throughout the country, we are conditioned to believe that one should not question the concept of racial equality or seriously consider the idea that race actually <em>matters</em>. </p>
<h2 id=""theeducationofaconservative"">The Education of a Conservative</h2>
<p>As the former managing editor of <em>Human Events</em>, I can recall several instances in private discussions and editorial meetings in which the subject of race was simmering just below the surface of another issue—whether crime rates in the nation’s capital, immigration, or educational disparities in student achievement. </p>
<p>When the conversation became increasingly awkward in tiptoeing around the subject of race, one of the other top editor’s would caution: “I suppose we shouldn’t discuss <em>that</em>” and then would quickly move on to a safer subject. Mind you this is from a group of conservative editors who would frequently boast of taking brave stands on other topics. </p>
<p>However, it wasn’t that long ago when conservatives actually displayed some backbone when confronting racial matters. As an intern during the fall 1988 session of the National Journalism Center, a program for young conservative journalists founded by former newspaper editor and author M. Stanton Evans, I remember one  of the Friday afternoon lectures when conservative columnist Robert Novak explained the various types of leaks that journalists frequently encountered in covering political stories during a presidential campaign. 
Novak clarified the divisions across the conservative spectrum, noting that there were “neoconservatives,” “social conservatives,” “cultural conservatives,” and even “<em>racial</em> conservatives.” His point seemed to stir a mix of curiosity and bewilderment among my fellow interns. Although Novak didn’t elaborate on what he meant by “racial conservatives,” I had an idea of what he had in mind. </p>
<p>Since the mid-1950s, the activist political left has been the driving force for “social justice” and the overall leveling of ethnic, race, and class-based differences in American society. The results of this political activism spawned the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> decisions, “civil rights” laws (including the “Open Housing” and “Voting Rights Acts”), affirmative action policies, court- ordered busing to achieve racial desegregation, the outlawing of merit-based employment testing in the private sector as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision in Griggs, and to a large extent, the current immigration crisis that has followed in the wake of the Immigration Act of 1965. </p>
<p>Steadfast conservatives once vigorously opposed radical egalitarian changes that the left has forced on American society and, in many instances, unabashedly represented the interests of their core constituents: white, middle-class voters—what Howard Dean has accurately identified as the base of the GOP. In another era, this constituency was known as the “Silent Majority.” Today, it is euphemistically referred to as “redstate America,” “soccer moms” and “NASCAR dads.” Hard-line conservatives of a previous generation staunchly opposed subversive left-wing activists who were determined to change society racially by transforming the culture, customs, and traditions (what the eminent sociologist William Graham 
Sumner coined “Folkways”) of America’s national character.  </p>
<p>Politically, this conservative continuum included Republican and southern Democratic politicians. Coalitions led by Sen. Barry Goldwater, who opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Ohio Rep. John M. Ashbrook, and Senators Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond, and James Eastland stymied radical egalitarian reforms to American society. Grassroots, patriotic activists to the right of the emerging conservative establishment formed patriotic organizations such as the John Birch Society and the Citizen’s Council. Medford Evans, a longtime contributor to <em>National Review</em> and <em>Human Events</em> (and M. Stanton Evans’s father), edited the Council’s monthly magazine The Citizen, a pro-segregationist publication. Broad coalitions of conservatives were politically savvy enough to usher-in the Reagan era just twelve years after the Great Society programs swept the nation. </p>
<p>Novak most likely had in mind these conservative stalwarts of another era, when no dependable conservative would have embraced Martin Luther King, Jr. as their role model. In this day and age it is difficult to imagine that prominent conservatives and congressional leaders vigorously contested legislation in the early 1980s that would enshrine Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday as a national holiday. </p>
<p>In 1983, <em>Human Events</em> led the charge among grassroots conservative activists against the passage of King’s birthday as a national holiday. In fact, <em>Human Events</em> led the conservative opposition to the radicalism of the civil rights movement, frequently exposing the communist affiliations and Marxist sympathies of the movement’s leadership, including King. Times have certainly changed indeed! </p>
<h2 id=""uncomfortabletruths"">Uncomfortable Truths</h2>
<p>All it takes is a little common- sense and some fortitude to admit that race is a fact of human affairs and that racial differences are embedded in human nature. Although taboo by today’s politically correct dogma, conservatives once recognized these truths—even if they didn’t dwell on them. However, simply admitting the realities of race in our increasingly “diverse” and politically correct society has become for some tantamount to advocating genocide. </p>
<p>Race has replaced Social Security as the “third rail” in American politics and civic life. (Consider the uproar a few years ago when Trent Lott was taken to task and forced to resign as Senate Majority Leader for reminiscing about the hypothetical prospects of the late Strom Thurmond’s success as a Dixiecrat presidential candidate in 1948.) Rest assured this didn’t occur by happenstance. Today, whenever  someone raises the possibility that racial <em>differences</em> may explain racial <em>disparities</em> in society, establishment conservatives simply collapse from anxiety or, worse, respond in a knee-jerk reaction. Acknowledging uncomfortable racial truths is a career-ending risk that I know all too well. </p>
<p>Last January I had to leave my job at Eagle Publishing (home of the Conservative Book Club, <em>Human Events</em>, and Regnery Publishing) after serving nearly three years as managing editor of <em>Human Events</em>. The reason: editing, entirely on my own free time, another publication, <em>The Occidental Quarterly</em> (<em>TOQ</em>), that addressed important cultural, racial, ethnic, and political issues facing the future of Western civilization. My work performance was never questioned. I enjoyed my work, got along well with the editors, valued the camaraderie and good will of my colleagues at Eagle, and always put forth my best effort to meet my employer’s expectations to produce a solid, informative conservative weekly newspaper. </p>
<p>However, one afternoon last January, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a fanatical left-wing organization, called my office supervisors to inquire about my work for <em>Human Events</em>, the <em>Evans and Novak Political Report</em> (an Eagle newsletter), and a “white supremacist” publication (<em>TOQ</em>) that I had been editing in my spare time. To my boss, Heidi Beirich of the SPLC was a faceless, nameless individual. Nevertheless, without hesitation or reservation, my superiors at Eagle accepted at face value her accusations and descriptions about my avocational work. Three years of collegial respect simply vanished instantaneously over accusations that were never questioned. </p>
<p>Much of the day passed on a routine schedule when late that afternoon, Tom Winter, the editor in chief of <em>Human Events</em>, sternly demanded that I follow him to the office conference room. I sensed at that point we were not going to discuss a raise or promotion. Near the end of a ten-minute interrogation about my work with <em>TOQ</em>, the vice president of the company said, “How do you think we should handle this?” I was given a few seconds to decide to either resign or be fired. For personal reasons, I decided to resign and we filed out of the conference room as people would leave a wake at a funeral. </p>
<p>As I was packing up my possessions in my office, Winter showed up and complimented me for my work as managing editor. One could sense a degree of unease about what had transpired. He didn’t seem to know much about the SPLC and their aggressive agenda to undermine any threat to egalitarianism; for conservatives of his generation, the embodiment of evil liberalism had always been the ACLU. We talked briefly as I scrambled to find empty spare boxes around the office corridors for my family photos and personal mementos. He tried to smooth things out, but his own admission that I was a “good” managing editor was only a kick in the teeth. It was then that I fully realized the full force and pressure of political correctness, as decreed by the far left to a prominent conservative publication. My departure from Eagle was a politically expedient way to avoid the likely negative publicity that the SPLC could stoke if Eagle ignored their claims. </p>
<p>Breaking the news to my wife later that evening, awaking her after our two daughters were asleep, was one of the most difficult experiences I’ve had to face. How do you explain to your wife that you lost your job— not for some work-related grievance—but for exercising your first-amendment rights and, as a freelancer, expressing a point of view? Other staff members freelanced regularly on the side without losing their job as a result. A few coworkers emailed me the next day shocked to discover my vacant office.</p>
<p>During the course of my interrogation with Eagle’s vice president and the top two <em>Human Events</em> editors, I asked why I <em>had</em> to either resign or get fired. The response was, “we think you know why.” Mind you, this is an employer whose owner boasts about upholding “traditional American values of free enterprise, limited government, and <em>individual liberty</em>”— and presumably the U.S. Constitution. The SPLC couldn’t care less about the conservative values that my employer cherished. They were blind to the fact that the SPLC’s agenda actively tried to undermine the individual liberty and limited government of traditional patriotic Americans. </p>
<p>Although I had made it a point not to discuss my freelance work around the office, out of respect for my colleagues who might have strong opinions and disagreements on controversial subjects, I suspected that questions would eventually surface about the journal. However, since four individuals around the office had some knowledge of my involvement with <em>TOQ</em>—three Eagle employees, including a senior editor at my sister company Regnery publishing and a former co-owner of the paper—I figured that since little was said and the reaction seemed to be one of indifference, perhaps nothing would come of my moonlighting work. If no one at Eagle had raised any complaints, which I suspect no one did, what would there be to complain about? Not to mention I thought it would be ironic that sharing a collegial working arrangement with two members of the Regnery family (cousins by relation)—the one a member of Eagle’s corporate board and former publisher of Regnery, the other a friend and publisher of <em>TOQ</em>—would be a career-ending juxtaposition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the way Eagle abruptly dealt with my severance from the company was more callous than I could ever have anticipated. The reaction was swift, cold, and harsh. (I received a few days pay and compensation for sick leave, vacation time and benefits.) As the father of two precious daughters and a wonderful wife, I couldn’t imagine how a so-called “family oriented” employer could react so ruthlessly. It would have been one thing to say, “We see a conflict of interest, we don’t like how you spend your time outside the office, but in appreciation of your valued work for the company, here’s a few months compensation. We wish you the best of luck.” Nothing doing—I had to evacuate that evening and leave my access card to the building, as if I couldn’t be trusted to return and pack up my personal possessions. </p>
<p>The late syndicated columnist Sam Francis once said that when he was fired from <em>The Washington Times</em> the experience was comparable psychologically to what a rape victim encounters after a violent rape. As Sam perceptively put it, you feel personally violated, as if you needed to disinfect yourself by taking a thorough shower. I felt the same way . </p>
<p>The fact that a radical left-wing organization like the SPLC could generate such a swift response out of not just any conservative employer, but historically the flagship publication of social conservatives, who politically remain entirely at odds with the SPLC’s outlook, is mind-boggling. <em>Human Events</em> selected Judge Roy Moore for their man-of-the-year award in 2003 for his principled stand in his fight to keep the Ten Commandments monument in his courtroom. The SPLC filed the suit against Judge Moore that resulted in the removal of the monument. Furthermore, SPLC’s founder Morris Dees said in March 2004, “The most dangerous threat in America today is not from the Ku Klux Klan and it's not from the Neo Nazis, it's from the religious right.” Dees added, “I think of Judge Roy Moore in Montgomery, Alabama. . . . We took that case because it was a case of extreme religious intolerance.” </p>
<p>One might think that the editors of <em>Human Events</em> would have sneered at the SPLC’s effort to purge one of its employees, given the group’s radical outlook. (The SPLC smears the American Enterprise Institute for having scholars who are indirectly affiliated with a so-called “hate” group.) SPLC’s sister organization’s website, Tolerance.org, has a glowing interview with former Weatherman and radical educator Bill Ayers, an unrepentant advocate of Communism, who as recently as 1995 described himself as “...a radical, Leftist, small ‘c’ communist.” As he candidly admits in a published interview, “the ethics of Communism still appeal to me.” Ayers is married to former Weatherman radical Bernardine Dohrn, who in 1969, according to the Claremont Institute, attended a Weather Underground “war council” in Michigan, in which “Dohrn gave a three-fingered ‘fork salute’ to mass murderer Charles Manson. Calling Manson’s victims the ‘Tate Eight,’ Dohrn gloated over the fact that actress Sharon Tate, who was pregnant at the time, had been stabbed with a fork in her womb. ‘Dig it. First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, they even shoved a fork into a victim's stomach! Wild!’” To think that <em>Human Events</em>, a staunchly anti-Communist periodical that unapologetically defends Joseph McCarthy and Gen. Augusto Pinochet, would force a loyal employee to resign out of fear of the SPLC would have been, until very recently, inconceivable. </p>
<h2 id=""therightsleftwarddrift"">The Right’s Leftward Drift</h2>
<p>What explains this bizarre spectacle? </p>
<p>Over the years, especially since the 1980s, the right has drifted leftward along with the rest of the political culture, especially on controversial issues involving race, multiculturalism, and “diversity.” A good example is <em>Human Events</em>, which has drifted far from the staunchly conservative views that it once championed not so long ago. </p>
<p>In 1973, <em>Human Events</em> published “A Tale of Two Heretics,” an article by M. Stanton Evans that defended the research of Arthur R. Jensen, then a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the late Richard Herrnstein of Harvard University. Evans described Jensen and Herrnstein as “two respected professors of psychology.” Four years earlier Jensen had published a controversial paper in the <em>Harvard Educational Review</em> in which he argued that the underlying cause of the black/white IQ gap, as measured by valid intelligence tests, was largely genetic in origin. He provided a wealth of material to support his claim and has since published several books to substantiate his thesis. His 1969 paper remains one of the most cited pieces of scholarship in the social science literature. He revisited the controversy and uproar that ensued following his 1969 paper in his 1973 book, <em>Genetics and Education</em>. In the early 70s, Jensen received death threats, students disrupted his classes, and he was eventually assigned a security guard to help him get around the Berkeley campus. </p>
<p>Herrnstein’s 1973 book <em>I.Q. and the Meritocracy</em> received widespread condemnation from the left for claiming that differences in intelligence explained the socioeconomic stratification that existed in American society. Class differences, poverty and economic disparities were not the result of capitalism or oppression, Herrnstein argued, but primarily the result of differences in IQ. He also received similar treatment from the radical left and was the subject of protests on the Harvard campus. </p>
<p>Evans defended the general thrust of their arguments and, in a well-written summary of their books, denounced the liberal attacks and attempted censorship aimed against them in academic circles. In summarizing how both were subjected to treatment that few left- wing academics ever experience, Evans writes, “These parallel stories from our enlightened campuses tell us much about the condition of freedom of speech and publication in America today, as construed by radical activists and certain members of the liberal professoriate. Leftward tolerance of ‘dissent’ will obviously extend just so far and Herrnstein and Jensen have exceeded the limits. Where hereditarian heresies are concerned, the radicals will not permit expression and conventional liberals in many cases will not defend it—although there are various honorable exceptions to both rules.” </p>
<p>The same can be said of today’s conservative establishment (in general) and <em>Human Events</em> (in particular). In June 2002, Ann Coulter, the legal affairs correspondent for <em>Human Events</em>, wrote a first-rate column titled, “Murdering <em>The Bell Curve</em>,” which appeared in <em>Human Events</em>. She lambasted liberals for suddenly discovering the validity of IQ tests—since the results could be used in court to get convicted murderers off death row. I had been away vacationing that week and noticed, after it appeared in the paper, that one of our reporters had inserted the paperback release date (1996) as the initial publication of the book, which actually was first published in the fall of 1994. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the late political economist and author Jude Wanniski emailed the editors at <em>Human Events</em>, hysterically criticizing Ann’s favorable mention of <em>The Bell Curve</em>, denouncing it as a highly flawed book that rested on faulty social science research, citing Gregg Easterbrook’s critique from <em>The Washington Monthly</em>, and noting that of more than a hundred scholars who defended the book in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, no credible biologist or geneticist supported the book’s findings. His error was to assume that no psychologist who supported <em>The Bell Curve</em>’s thesis had any adequate understanding of genetics. (A high school biology student would know that, based merely on his professional credentials as an economist, Wanniski would know even less about genetics than a psychologist.) </p>
<p>Anyone familiar with <em>The Bell Curve</em> or the controversy that engulfed the book upon its publication in 1994 could easily spot these inaccuracies, as well as wild, unsupportable generalizations in Wanniski’s screed, including the number of scholars who signed the statement of support that appeared on the op/ed page of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (the actual number was 52), so I thought it would be a good idea to publish his letter, followed by an editor’s note explaining our error in botching the original publication date of <em>The Bell Curve</em>. Plus, it would offer to our readers a point-by-point rebuttal to Wanniski’s blunders. I drafted a note and then provided Winter with a proof of the page to edit. 
The next morning I noticed Winter downstairs outside the Eagle office building proofing pages on his cigarette break. As I exchanged greetings and headed into the building’s lobby, he said he had one question about my comments on Wanniski’s letter. I figured he would drop by in a few minutes and raise the point. Most of the day had passed when he finally came around to my office, a nervous wreck, leaning over next to me, explaining, “I’m just nervous about being called a ‘racist’,” as he read off some of the scholars I had listed in the editor’s note. When he got to Arthur Jensen’s name, he had asked that I edit it out since he was told that Jensen was a “racist.” Although I knew this wasn’t true, I complied with his request. Other than that, he had no other text changes. 
As he was leaving the office, I had discovered that Winter had contacted several close friends and former associates throughout the afternoon to check to see if any of them had read <em>The Bell Curve</em>. He had faxed over a copy of the letter to Stan Evans (of all individuals) to see if he had read Herrnstein and Murray’s book, accompanied by an urgent note to get back to him ASAP. I couldn’t help but think to myself: this is (pinch me) <em>Human Events</em>?!? Is this the same publication that on more than one occasion vigorously defended Jensen and Herrnstein? What’s going on? Since Coulter has even mentioned that <em>The Bell Curve</em> 
is one of her favorite books, how could clarifying misstatements and inaccuracies about the book create so much anxiety? </p>
<h2 id=""airbrushingtherecord"">Airbrushing the Record</h2>
<p>Shortly after I had left the paper in January, Tom Winter was quoted in a UPI story as saying, “In its 60- year history, <em>Human Events</em> had never ‘knowingly hired a racist, never published racist articles, and never tolerated racist sympathies...and we never will.’” This may be true, but he had no problem granting <em>The Citizen</em>, the monthly publication of the Citizen’s Council, in August 1979 permission to reprint Stan Evans’ eyewitness account of the Rhodesian election that first appeared in <em>Human Events</em>. </p>
<p>Moreover, this is the same publication that once published detailed critiques of egalitarianism, such as John O’Hara’s 1965 article, “Is There a Brotherhood of Man?” It also published David Brudnoy’s laudatory review of Jared Taylor’s <em>Paved With Good Intentions</em> in 1993. In the full-page review, Brudnoy noted 
that “Taylor’s analysis of the double standards operating in America and of the overall circumstance of the underclass is unsurpassed in a single volume intended for the general reader.” Brudnoy goes on to point out that “Jared Taylor has produced a document of first-rate significance for analyzing where we are.” The irony of <em>Human Events</em> publishing this glowing review of Taylor’s book is that it was Sam Francis’s affiliation with Taylor’s monthly newsletter <em>American Renaissance</em> that contributed to Francis’s banishment from the pages of <em>Human Events</em>. His biweekly syndicated column frequently appeared in <em>Human Events</em>, occasionally on the cover of the paper, throughout the late 80s and early 90s but after Francis lost his job with <em>The Washington Times</em> his column likewise vanished from the pages of <em>Human Events</em>. Winter would edit his name from the text whenever it mentioned Francis favorably just as the Soviets would airbrush an ex-comrade out of existence. </p>
<p>Contrary to Winter’s professed pronouncements against “racism,” <em>Human Events</em> in fact had a history of publishing provocative commentary on race and politics, and maintained affiliations with segregationist-minded politicians and journalists. It once published the writings of Major Gen. J. F. C. Fuller, a leading historian of military strategy and a former supporter of Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, and Professor Hans Sennholz, an economist and ex-Luftwaffe pilot who was also listed as a contributing editor of <em>American Opinion</em>. There was a time when the editors of <em>Human Events</em> would have defied their radical critics in the face of controversy, but the change in ownership in the mid 1990s ushered in a new era in which the editors would repeatedly buckle under to the pragmatic business and political interests of its owner, Thomas Phillips. Phillips, a mover and shaker in elite GOP circles, understands that in order to sell space to major advertisers (a modern necessity for keeping his publication as far out of the red ink as possible), one must not jeopardize one’s business standing with prospective advertisers. It is simply unacceptable by today’s standards to challenge contemporary egalitarian dogma on race.</p>
<p>The point conservatives fail to understand is that the use of the vacuous word “racist” by groups such as the SPLC, as investigative author Laird Wilcox has noted, is a tactic to smear conservatives and to stifle discussion of controversial issues. What is perceived to be “racist” by today’s standard would have been a perfectly acceptable and legitimate point of view by yesterday’s benchmark. Furthermore, Winter’s point is rather misleading. It is true that over the years <em>Human Events</em> was careful in confronting the issue of race. It never was explicitly a racial publication and it would be inappropriate to 
characterize it as such, but by the same token it was never a champion of radical egalitarian social policies and routinely opposed forced busing, Head Start, affirmative action, and aggressively exposed the Communist influence within the civil rights movement. The paper’s editors tacitly understood that grassroots cultural conservatives, such as Birchers and members of the Southern Citizen’s Council, formed a considerable core of <em>Human Events</em>’ readership base. As such the paper unapologetically looked up to prominent conservative public officials—including former segregationists, such as Strom Thurmond—without being explicitly racial in outlook.  </p>
<p>Consider other recent examples of how this once solidly conservative publication has drifted leftward and embraced politically correct perspectives. Two years ago <em>Human Events</em>’ editor Terry Jeffrey insisted on using for the cover of the paper a color photo of Martin Luther King, Jr. from his historic 1963 speech to accompany Linda Chavez’s column criticizing the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the University of Michigan’s affirmative action policy. <em>Human Events</em> had historically been enormously critical of King and his reported Communist affiliations. The paper in 1983 reprinted in full text Jesse Helms’ speech detailing the full range of conservative objections to making King’s birthday a national holiday, including the infamous photograph of King at the Highlander Folk School run by Marxist Myles Horton, which appeared throughout the South on billboards in the 1960s. By publishing this large, laudatory image of King on the cover of <em>Human Events</em>, the editors must have made a number of older readers scratch their heads wondering if this is the same publication they were reading twenty years ago (hint: it isn’t). </p>
<p>In March 2003, I approached Jeffrey about covering the “Lincoln Reconsidered” conference that was being held later that month in Richmond, Va. I thought it would make for a perfect “Conservative Forum” item in <em>Human Events</em>—just a brief description of the event from someone in attendance. He expressed interest in it so I called and received a press pass from Ron Holland, one of the organizers of the conference, and he was thrilled to have <em>Human Events</em> cover the one- day forum. A number of authors and scholars were scheduled for the event, including Emory University professor Donald Livingstone; Clyde Wilson, a contributor to <em>Chronicles</em> and professor at the University of South Carolina; Thomas DiLorenzo of Loyola College and author of <em>The Real Lincoln</em> (a hot-selling featured selection offered by <em>Human Events</em>’ sister company The Conservative Book Club); and Paul Gottfried of Elizabethtown College. </p>
<p>After writing a brief description of the event and having it proofread shortly before our Thursday press 
deadline, Jeffrey came around to my office and said that he had second thoughts about publishing it, the event wasn’t exactly what he initially had in mind, and to publicize it would divide conservatives who were split on Lincoln’s legacy. Since he thought it would be “divisive” to publish an uncritical account of the conference, Jeffrey believed that dividing conservatives over contested issues would be counter productive. I complied with his request and replaced the item. I thought at the time, if someone approached Jeffrey and had argued the point that taking a rigid, pro-life position (prohibiting abortion even in cases of rape and incest) is “divisive” among conservatives— splitting social conservatives from libertarian-leaning conservatives— he wouldn’t have cared less. In his mind, conservatives are expected to be pro-life, if they aren’t, that’s their problem, not his. When it comes to politically taboo subjects, such as race, or even criticizing Lincoln or King, conservatives are expected to conform to conventional dogma and agree <em>not</em> to disagree. </p>
<p>The leftward drift of <em>Human Events</em> away from bedrock conservative positions isn’t limited to the issue of race. Over the years, <em>Human Events</em> has been the leading pro-family publication among grassroots social conservatives with a well-known editorial view that firmly opposed the agenda of homosexual activists, such as “gay marriage.”</p>
<p>In 1960, <em>Human Events</em> published one of its more popular feature articles, “Homosexual International” by Countess Waldeck. One morning I received a call from one of our readers in Arizona inquiring about how he could obtain copies of the article. I asked Winter and he immediately recounted how popular the article was at the time it was published. He pinpointed the date range and I quickly found it. The article began by noting that the Deputy Undersecretary of State Carlisle Humelstine had ousted 119 homosexuals from the State Department in 1951. I made several photocopies of the article and sent them to our Arizona reader. </p>
<p>In fact, as early as the mid-1980s <em>Human Events</em> published numerous articles critical of the emerging, aggressive homosexual subculture. Articles such as Stan Evans’ “AIDS: Homosexual Plague,” and lengthy reviews of books such as <em>The Homosexual Network</em> by Father Enrique T. Rueda appeared on a regular basis. Allan Brownfeld’s review of Rueda’s book noted, “There was a time in America, in the very recent past, when psychiatry viewed homosexuality as an illness and churches viewed it as a sin. Homosexuals remained ‘in the closet,’ and were as discreet as possible in pursuing their sexual proclivities. . . . Now, however, we no longer speak of homosexuals, but of ‘gay people,’ and instead of thinking 
of in terms of illness or sin we refer to ‘alternative lifestyles.’”</p>
<p>Again, times have certainly changed. One of the complaints I had to deal with on a regular basis was from one of the editors who wrote hard-hitting copy about outrageous homosexual news items in blunt language—the sort of reporting that had regularly appeared in <em>Human Events</em>. Winter would make it a point to tone down the rhetoric, replacing “homosexual” and “sodomite” with “gay” in proofing the text. Winter was especially concerned that fag- bashing epithets would offend Jeffrey Carneal, the president of Eagle, the parent company of <em>Human Events</em>, who is widely alleged to be homosexual. </p>
<p>A major concern shared by some of the <em>Human Events</em> staff was a perceived need to placate Carneal’s sensitivity to homosexual issues. The editors walked on eggshells in trying to balance the conservative, pro- family values of <em>Human Events</em> readers and Carneal’s whispered homosexuality. For the record, Carneal is listed as a donor to the Whitman-Walker Clinic, a “community-based health organization ... established by and for the gay and lesbian community .” According to Federal Election Commission records, he contributed $500 in June 2003 to the reelection campaign of Rep. Mark Foley (R.- FL.), who has refused to answer questions about his alleged gay lifestyle. Foley also received a $500 contribution in June 2003 from the Log Cabin Republicans Political Action Committee, a gay Republican organization, and has received contributions from the Human Rights Campaign PAC, the leading homosexual organization that endorses candidates who support “gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender equality.”</p>
<p>Occasionally Carneal and the editors would butt heads over gay- related issues. He was beside himself after the editors decided to defend Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA.) in a front page piece that supported the senator’s stated opposition to the recklessly promiscuous lifestyle of homosexuals. Carneal confronted the paper’s editor in his office in what was described as a tense and heated exchange. He would always argue his point of view on libertarian grounds, but it seemed clear to the editors what was really behind it all. </p>
<p>On more than one occasion Carneal referred to <em>Human Events</em> as an “ultra-conservative” publication. During one year-end recognition award ceremony, devoted to selecting the “employee of the year” at Eagle Publishing’s annual Christmas party, Carneal introduced a member of the graphics department as someone who had the “misfortune” of having to work with the <em>Human Events</em> staff on deadline. The paper’s editor, sitting right next to me, angrily remarked, “What an a--hole!” and immediately walked  out of the party. Some suspected that Carneal’s attitude—his rare compliments to the staff, nitpicking involvement on editorial decisions, and occasional jabs—stemmed quite likely, in part, because of the paper’s editorial view of homosexuality . </p>
<h2 id=""toughonimmigration"">Tough on Immigration?</h2>
<p>One of the issues that Jeffrey prides himself in leading the charge in <em>Human Events</em> is the problem of illegal immigration. As a former director of Pat Buchanan’s presidential campaign, he is tougher and remains more focused on social and cultural issues. (Winter would frequently describe cultural issues, such as multiculturalism and “diversity,” as “boring.”) Jeffrey considers himself as first and foremost a conservative, then a Republican, and would be willing to take the Bush administration to task on issues such as gay marriage, stem-cell research, border security, and illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Consequently <em>Human Events</em> has published some first-rate reporting on the problems of border security, terrorism, and lack of resolve on the part of public officials in halting the flow of illegal immigrants across our borders. Much of this reportage, however, has been through the post- 9/11 prism of terrorism and national security. As important as it is, there are other aspects of the immigration issue that get far less attention—if any at all—in the pages of <em>Human Events</em>. For example, where is the paper in leading the discussion on having a moratorium on legal immigration? Why don’t they just come right out and admit that generally speaking <em>some</em> immigrants are more preferable than others? Why not just admit that “diversity” has its limits and this demographic trend is proving to be detrimental to our nation’s survival. Some on the staff shared the view that Hispanic immigrants could be converted into dedicated Republicans and the country would be one harmonious giant Disneyland as a result. Just as long as they’re not Democrats—then everything will be fine. </p>
<p>Historically, the paper published occasional pieces on immigration, some articles like Palmer Stacy’s “Uncontrolled Immigration: Silent Threat to America,” were exceptionally informative. However, in 1965 <em>Human Events</em> had peculiarly little to say about the Immigration Act that passed in early October of that year, an event that historian Otis Graham has described as “the single most nation-changing measure of the era.” Despite the fact that it was one of the big “Great Society” reforms under the Johnson Administration, it never received the intense scrutiny that other “Great Society” measures did in <em>Human Events</em>. The paper published one brief op/ed that first appeared in the <em>Arizona Republic</em>, “Limit Needed on All Immigration,” in early October 1965 and a small news item, “Immigration Ceiling Advances,” in September 1965.</p>
<p>The fact that the Senate bill passed by a margin of 76 to 18 indicates that the paper was reluctant to criticize a measure that had this much political support and given that almost all the opposition to it came from southern politicians. In today’s post-9/11 political climate, given the public’s sentiments on illegal immigration and the ever growing congressional coalition for immigration reform led by Rep. Tancredo, <em>Human Events</em> aggressively publishes articles such as the June 13, 2005 cover story, “Is Your Security Guard an Illegal?,” which at best nibbles around the edge of America’s ongoing landmark demographic transition. Is it really that courageous to thunder on about America’s immigration crisis after the fact?   </p>
<p>The paper’s reluctance in criticizing renegade Republicans on the issue of immigration is highlighted by an instance last year in which one of the paper’s more informative freelance writers, Jim Edwards, an adjunct fellow with the Hudson Institute, had submitted a piece critical of Utah Rep. Chris Cannon’s amnesty program titled “Loose Cannon in Utah.” The piece highlighted Cannon’s abysmal record on immigration legislation, which in many instances bucked his constituents’ interests, and triggered a GOP primary challenge by former state legislator Matt Throckmorton. Winter always liked Edwards’ columns and suggested that we publish this one. He forwarded it to me for publication and to our web editor to post on the website. </p>
<p>A short while after it appeared on our website, I worked it into the paper. The next week while on vacation, I received two frantic messages on my cell phone from Winter, “Kevin, I know you’re on vacation, but please call me as soon as you can.” I returned his call and he seemed puzzled by the fact that we published Edward’s piece, especially with the headline, “Loose Cannon in Utah.” Since Carneal had called him and hit the roof, he wanted me to describe the piece to him so he could explain to Carneal what happened. He couldn’t remember proofing the article. I reminded him that Edward’s article had been up on the web and that I received the column from him to publish. It had turned out that Rep. Cannon is related to Eagle board member Joseph A. Cannon, the chairman of the board of Geneva Steel, Inc. Carneal was concerned about Cannon’s reaction to reading something so critical about his family member in <em>Human Events</em> and berated Winter for running it. </p>
<p>The episode revealed that the conservative establishment has in many instances jettisoned principled stands to convenience and profit. It also reinforced the over sensitivity that conservatives have to criticism. For establishment conservatives, what is important is <em>image</em> over substance. Celebrity status and fame—being chic—drives profits. It explains the modern business mentality of “conservative” executives like Carneal. <em>Human Events</em> dropped Ted Baehr’s mini reviews of films, a family-oriented feature popular with many parents given his detailed ratings for foul language and nudity that were often informative. Well, it wasn’t swank enough for Carneal’s tastes (he would ridicule it in editorial meetings) and eventually it was dropped as a regular feature. Carneal was always urging the editors to come up with something “Drudgeable” so that Matt Drudge could link to it and drive his followers to the <em>Human Events</em> website. It was a good way to gin up business, but in many respects the editors were less interested in becoming trend-setters and appealing to Drudge than giving <em>Human Events</em> readers solid if less sensational news, and at the same time maintain the paper’s continuity—its look, content and features—which had been established over the years. </p>
<h2 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In his recent book <em>Winning the Future</em>, Newt Gingrich complains that “Since the 1960’s, the conservative majority has been intimidated, manipulated and bullied by the liberal minority. The liberal elites who dominate academia, the courts, the press and much of the government bureaucracy share an essentially European secular-socialist value system. Yet they have set the terms of the debate, which is why ‘politics as usual’ is a losing proposition for Americans.” </p>
<p>The reason why liberals have set the terms of the debate and have the upper hand in shutting out conservatives in the upper elites of society is because conservatives let them. A good example is the stifling of reasoned discussions and free inquiry into the genetic basis of racial differences in IQ and other personality traits. The reaction to the publication of <em>The Bell Curve</em> put conservatives on notice: there are real consequences to defending this area of scientific research. Egalitarians have fostered the current climate of political correctness that makes it impossible to candidly discuss matters involving race and avoid accusations of “racism.” By not confronting the left and then capitulating to accusations of “racism” and “intolerance,” conservatives let their adversaries establish the terms of what is considered “acceptable” and “politically correct” if, that is, you expect to be received into the corridors of power and influence. </p>
<p>For many beltway conservatives, attending the White House Christmas Party or Capitol Hill social event is the pinnacle of achievement—maintaining access to influential circles—and everything else is secondary. Anything that jeopardizes this social standing is considered “beyond the pale.” Status is the fuel that drives the conservative establishment. </p>
<p>It explains why conservatives have given up so much ground on issues that were once important to them: honesty and truth about race, IQ differences, egalitarianism, decadent societal trends, immigration restrictions, and the threat that ethnic balkanization poses to the future of American society. </p></div></div><div class=""sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule"" data-block-type=""47"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_1_1421346929371_19469""><div class=""sqs-block-content""><hr/></div></div><div class=""sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown"" data-block-type=""44"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_1_1421346929371_19605""><div class=""sqs-block-content""><p><strong>KEVIN LAMB</strong> has been published in <em>National Review</em>, <em>Chronicles</em>, the <em>Asian Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Mankind Quarterly</em>, <em>Middle American News</em>, <em>The Social Contract</em>, and <em>The Journal of Social, Political &amp; Economic Studies</em>.

<meta content=""In their 1993 Forbes article, “When Quotas Replace Merit, Everybody 
Suffers,” Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer determined that the “total 
shortfall” or cost attributed to federal compliance with affirmative-action 
policies and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations was 
close to four percent of GNP or well over $225 billion. As the authors 
pointed out, the total economic cost of racial preferences and diversity in 
both the private and public sector is difficult to pinpoint in an aggregate 
sum, but is not impossible to calculate in terms of a reasonably reliable 
estimate. The following paper analyzes the economic costs to taxpayers as a 
result of federal compliance with affirmative action and equal 
employment-based regulations. Estimates show “that for every dollar spent 
on regulatory enforcement, about twenty dollars is spent on compliance 
costs by the private sector.” The policy implications of federal EEOC 
regulations apply an unnecessary burden in terms of direct and indirect 
costs to taxpayers, in addition to undercutting merit-based employment 
practices, and therefore Executive Order 11246 and subsequent regulations 
should be repealed."" property=""og:description""/>

<p>In their 1993 <em>Forbes</em> article, “When Quotas Replace Merit, Everybody Suffers,” Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer determined that the “total shortfall” or cost attributed to federal compliance with affirmative-action policies and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations was close to four percent of GNP or well over $225 billion. As the authors pointed out, the total economic cost of racial preferences and diversity in both the private and public sector is difficult to pinpoint in an aggregate sum, but is not impossible to calculate in terms of a reasonably reliable estimate. The following paper analyzes the economic costs to taxpayers as a result of federal compliance with affirmative action and equal employment-based regulations. Estimates show “that for every dollar spent on regulatory enforcement, about twenty dollars is spent on compliance costs by the private sector.” The policy implications of federal EEOC regulations apply an unnecessary burden in terms of direct and indirect costs to taxpayers, in addition to undercutting merit-based employment practices, and therefore Executive Order 11246 and subsequent regulations should be repealed.</p>
<h2>Racial Preferences Thrive under the Bush Administration</h2>
<p>President Bush says he is against quotas and racial preferences. During the 2004 presidential campaign he stated that the best way to help minority businesses is to open all contracts to competitive bidding “....so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their businesses going.” “Minority ownership of businesses is up,” the president said, “because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn1"" id=""ffn1"">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet from day one the Bush administration has backed affirmative-action plans. The first opportunity came in August 2001 when the administration asked the Supreme Court to uphold a Transportation Department program intended to help minority contractors. In its brief, the Bush Justice Department took the same position that the Clinton administration had in the case, which grew out of a challenge by a White-owned construction company in Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>The company, Adarand Constructors, submitted the low bid for a Transportation Department contract. But the contract was awarded to a minority contractor as part of the department’s “disadvantaged business enterprise.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">2</a></sup> In its 50-page brief, the Bush Justice Department asserted that “the program is not unconstitutional,” noting that all companies that are economically disadvantaged could apply for the same preferences in receiving contracts.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">3</a></sup> Of course, their solution discriminated against the more efficient non-minority contractor, as preference programs usually do. That didn’t bother the White House. Even the George Bush regime seems—or at least seemed—interested in the rights of particular groups rather than colorblind equality.</p>
<p>When it comes to affirmative action, the Bush administration goes by the book: The Federal Code of Regulations states that individuals who certify that they are members of named groups (Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian Pacific, Sub-continental-Asian) are to be considered socially and economically disadvantaged. Under some programs, women “shall be presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,” too.</p>
<p>The rules affect everything from “surface transportation,” which requires that 10 percent of federal monies go to minority and female contractors, to the space program, which requires that 8 percent of the dollar value of its contracts go to such firms. The Small Business Administration reserves portions of its contracts for, among others, Asian-Americans, Sri Lankans, Tongans, and “Hasidic Jewish Americans.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn4"" id=""ffn4"">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Nor does government intervention end when a company hires the appropriate percentage of minorities. An initiative began by the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in the early 1990s requires companies to focus on promotion and pay disparities among workers of different races and genders.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn5"" id=""ffn5"">5</a></sup> </p>
<h2>DEFINING DISADVANTAGED UP</h2>
<p>Reports of the death of affirmative action are premature. But this is not your father’s affirmative action: Companies owned by White females are eligible for consideration as disadvantaged businesses under the Transportation Department program supported by the Bush Administration. Nineteen separate federally mandated preference programs are designed to benefit “economically disadvantaged” bankers.</p>
<p>Wealthy minorities can buy broadcast licenses from existing license holders in so-called “distress sales” for as little as 75 percent of fair market value, while others can’t even compete. The FCC also exempts “minority-controlled broadcast facilities” from rules restricting multiple ownership of such facilities.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn6"" id=""ffn6"">6</a></sup> Such provisions tilt the playing field against non-minority entrepreneurs striving to attain the wealth enjoyed by their minority competitors.</p>
<p>Obviously the government doesn’t define “disadvantaged” the way you or I do. An estimated 70 percent of the nation’s population is now legally eligible for federal contracts and affirmative-action benefits on the basis of their alleged disadvantages. But in the government’s eyes the son of an unemployed White Detroit auto worker is more privileged than the daughter of a Manhattan surgeon of color.</p>
<p>Reverse discrimination is the law of the land. To affirmative action ideologues, however, it’s “pay back” time, when White American males must atone for their alleged economic advantages—even if they grew up poor. “White males are the only growth area for the modern victim movement,” says John Leo, a contributing editor at <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>. “Everybody else is covered.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn7"" id=""ffn7"">7</a></sup> In typical Washington style, a program designed to aid “disadvantaged minorities” metastasizes into a near-universal entitlement. Is there a method to this madness? You bet: By casting a wide affirmative-action net the federal government has vastly increased political support for such programs.</p>
<h2>Quotas By Any Other Name</h2>
<p>Quotas are explicitly banned in both the 1964 and 1991 Civil Rights Acts. Minority hiring ratios are officially just “goals” for achieving a balanced” workforce in which the number of female and minority employees reflects their share of the underlying population. Failure to meet a goal does not subject the employer to legal sanctions—as long as “good faith” efforts were made.</p>
<p>At least that’s what Executive Order 11246 said when it established affirmative-action programs for Federal agencies back in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Two things stand out about the current system of goals/quotas. First, they cover a wide swath of U.S. companies. All employers with more than fifteen staff, public, private, or non-profit, come under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. All are obligated to match the mix of new hires with the racial, ethnic, and gender mix of qualified applicants. All can be sued by the EEOC for “discrimination” if the racial and gender mix of new hires differs sufficiently from the availability of such workers. EEOC regulations cover nearly 90 percent of the non-farm private sector workforce.</p>
<p>Then there is E.O. 11246 administered by the Labor Department’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). The Executive Order requires all Federal contractors and subcontractors with contracts worth more than $10,000 per year to prepare and file affirmative action plans. More than 400,000 corporations, covering about 42 percent of the private sector workforce, are under its purview.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn8"" id=""ffn8"">8</a></sup> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, what makes these statistical “guidelines” and “goals” so appealing is the very thing that undermines their credibility: They are easily distorted and misinterpreted by government bureaucrats. Any deviation between hiring goals and population ratios can be construed as intentional discrimination—no matter what the underlying reality.</p>
<p>The threat of costly litigation has forced many employers to protect themselves by hiring unqualified minorities to satisfy the numerical goals. Even this isn’t enough to satisfy affirmative-action activists. In 1997, for example, five discrimination lawsuits were filed on behalf of Black, Asian, and female employees of Boeing.</p>
<p>Boeing is the nation’s largest defense contractor, with over $18 billion in federal contracts. It is the largest employer of minorities and females in the aerospace industry.</p>
<p>Boeing did not contest the two largest suits and instead agreed to pay $20 million to settle out of court. Jessie Jackson figured prominently in brokering the largest of the settlements—$15 million for Black employees. Several non-profit organizations he controls profited handsomely from the deal.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn9"" id=""ffn9"">9</a></sup> </p>
<p>In its analysis of Boeing’s alleged diversity lapses, the EEOC ignored seniority or years of service. Nevertheless, the contractor has subsequently spent more than $1.3 <em>billion</em> on race and gender based initiatives.</p>
<p>In November 2000, Coca Cola became the second U.S. firm to cave in to racial extortion demands of minority workers. In this case four Black employees charged that the company (a) underpaid them because they are Black and (b) created a hostile work environment. In addition to a $193 million cash settlement, Coke committed to spend $1 <em>billion</em> to promote business opportunities for preferred minorities and women.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn10"" id=""ffn10"">10</a></sup> </p>
<p>Oh yes: the allegations against Coke were never proven in a court of law.</p>
<p>Similarly, Texaco agreed to settle disparate pay claims for about $3.1 million in 1999—the largest settlement in a glass ceiling case up to that time. Back pay was awarded, ranging from $1,700 to $51,000, as well as pay raises.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn11"" id=""ffn11"">11</a></sup> Once again the government made no finding of discrimination.</p>
<p>If discrimination is as widespread as activists claim, surely it exists in small and medium-sized companies also. Yet no federal lawsuit has ever been filed against such firms. Instead the legal actions have been directed solely at companies big enough to pay mega settlement amounts. Affirmative-action shakedowns seem to be about money rather than equality and justice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the list of companies that have capitulated to unsubstantiated charges of racial discrimination reads like a Who’s Who of U.S. business. The legal threats have created a “quota culture” in many U.S. corporations. Kodak’s employee manual spells out in great detail what constitutes unacceptable views towards its diversity policies, along with steps employees should follow to notify management of violators.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn12"" id=""ffn12"">12</a></sup> Xerox ties a portion of its managers’ bonuses to how well they promoted diversity efforts at the company.</p>
<p>Most ominous of all, United Airlines has reportedly reduced training requirements and pilot qualifications in order to hire the “right” number of selected minorities.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn13"" id=""ffn13"">13</a></sup></p>
<h2>LOOKING FOR DISCRIMINATION</h2>
<p>No discrimination? That may sound improbable to the average citizen, but not to the economists who study labor markets. In a free-market economy, competition among employers for the most productive workers precludes discrimination. Employers who pay minority workers less than their “marginal product” will lose those workers to competitors. They will not survive. This process can be forestalled only by monopoly or government intervention—both of which occurred, for example, in South Africa under apartheid. And now in the U.S., under affirmative action.</p>
<p>Education and work experience are the two most reliable predictors of a worker’s earnings. Black workers have historically been far less educated than White workers. Adjusting for racial differences in education levels, test scores, and work experience, 70 percent to 85 percent of the gap in income levels between White and Black workers disappears. For Black college graduates, the gap more than vanishes. Harvard economist Richard Freeman finds: “By the late 1970s, young Black male college graduates attained rough income parity with young White graduates. Joseph Conti reports [in <em>Challenging the Civil Rights Establishment: Profiles of a New Black Vanguard</em>] that ‘black college-educated females currently earn 125 percent of what White college educated females earn.’”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn14"" id=""ffn14"">14</a></sup> </p>
<p>All of which shows the fallacy underlying affirmative action in the American labor market.</p>
<p>The programs may even be counter-productive. Since the onset of affirmative action in the 1960s, the employment-population ratio for Black workers has deteriorated relative to that of Whites and Hispanics.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn15"" id=""ffn15"">15</a></sup> This could reflect the reluctance of employers to hire workers likely to file affirmative action lawsuits.</p>
<p>Minority unemployment usually responds to changing economic conditions more than White unemployment, reflecting the over-representation of Blacks in manufacturing and other highly cyclical sectors of the economy. The trend held in the early 1990s; it abruptly ended with the economic recovery under the second Bush Administration. Indeed, the Black unemployment rate is higher today than it was when the current economic recovery started thirteen quarters ago.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn16"" id=""ffn16"">16</a></sup> </p>
<p>Why the persistently high Black unemployment rate? Discrimination may be the best explanation—but not the sort of discrimination affirmative action is designed to combat. The most racist policy in this country for the past quarter century has been immigration policy. U.S. companies knowingly employ millions of illegal immigrants while the government looks the other way. The illegals are paid less than comparable native minorities, but they obviously cannot sue their employers.</p>
<h2>ECONOMIC COSTS</h2>
<p>The onslaught of poorly educated, mainly Hispanic, immigrants has stymied good faith efforts of low-income Americans—minority and White alike—to climb up the economic ladder.</p>
<p>If contracts were awarded to the lowest qualified bid, discrimination would not enter the picture. Firms that pay minority and female workers less than their “marginal product” would lose qualified workers—and their competitive advantage—to non-discriminating competitors. Eventually they would fold.</p>
<p>The Bush White House seems immune to this point, however. Using Clinton-era standards, the Commerce Department has labeled industries awarded roughly three-quarters of all federal contracts—a truly staggering sum—guilty of discrimination, thereby making female- and minority-owned firms in these industries eligible for a 10-percent bid shelter.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn17"" id=""ffn17"">17</a></sup> </p>
<p>Translation: Ten percent wiggle room on federal contracts for anyone of the appropriate skin color.</p>
<p>How much do federal set asides cost taxpayers?</p>
<p>Data provided to us by the Federal Procurement Data System shows $15.7 billion of federal contracts were awarded to firms owned by minorities and females in fiscal 2004. The amount of such contracts more than doubled since 2000:</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node=""true"">A typical “Affirmative Action/Non-Discrimination/MBE-WBE Requirement” document lists “participation goals” for the construction trades.

<p data-preserve-html-node=""true"">Public sector costs are substantial. The staffing and budget appropriations for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mushroomed during the 1990s, and have continued rising during the Bush years:</p>

<p>In 2005 an estimated 79,432 grievances will be filed with the EEOC—about the same annual amount as during its Clinton Administration heyday.</p>
<p>Research at the Center for the Study of American Business estimates that for every dollar spent on regulatory enforcement, about 20 dollars is spent on compliance costs by the private sector. Applying the 20-to-1 ratio to EEOC’s estimated outlays, we arrive at $6.5 billion as the estimated cost to private sector firms of complying with federal affirmative-action regulations in 2005.</p>
<p>Federal agencies spent a total of $1.7 billion to enforce all workplace regulations (affirmative-action-related and others) in 2005. That translates to private sector compliance costs of $21.4 billion. How many more minorities and females would be working today had that amount been plowed back into businesses?</p>
<h2>WHO BENEFITS?</h2>
<p>Minorities have made considerable social and economic progress since the 1960s. Dropout rates have declined, college attendance rates are up, and the Black middle-class has expanded. Minority wages have come closer to parity with Whites. These gains have occurred <em>despite</em>, rather than because of, affirmative action.</p>
<p>Here are some of the unintended consequences of the race and gender preferences enforced by the federal government:</p>
<ul>
<li>They benefit primarily the upper echelon of the preferred group (e.g., minority millionaires and political leaders) often to the detriment of non-preferred groups (e.g., poor Whites).</li>
<li>They put a cloud over minority workers who have advanced because of their innate ability.</li>
<li>They encourage non-preferred groups to fraudulently present themselves as members of preferred groups.</li>
<li>They reduce incentives of both groups to perform at their best—the preferred because they don’t have to, the non-preferred because extra effort seems futile.</li>
<li>They’ve increased incentives to hire illegal immigrants who cannot sue for alleged EEOC violations.</li>
<li>They’ve forced employers to spend billions on compliance instead of productive investments, thereby reducing employment opportunities for all groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>A rollback of affirmative action may be one of the most efficient pro-growth policies available to the federal government.</p>

Is neoconservatism a Jewish movement? Is it ""anti-Semitic"" to say so?</p>
<p>The thesis presented here is that neoconservatism is indeed a Jewish intellectual and political movement. This paper is the final installment in a three-part series on Jewish activism and reflects many of the themes of the first two articles. The first paper in this series focused on the traits of ethnocentrism, intelligence, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn1"" id=""ffn1"">[1]</a></sup> These traits will be apparent here as well. The ethnocentrism of the neocons has enabled them to create highly organized, cohesive, and effective ethnic networks. Neoconservatives have also exhibited the high intelligence necessary for attaining eminence in the academic world, in the elite media and think tanks, and at the highest levels of government. They have aggressively pursued their goals, not only in purging more traditional conservatives from their positions of power and influence, but also in reorienting U.S. foreign policy in the direction of hegemony and empire. Neoconservatism also illustrates the central theme of the second article in this series: In alliance with virtually the entire organized American Jewish community, neoconservatism is a vanguard Jewish movement with close ties to the most extreme nationalistic, aggressive, racialist, and religiously fanatic elements within Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Neoconservatism also reflects many of the characteristics of Jewish intellectual movements studied in my book, <em>The Culture of Critique</em><sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>TABLE 1: Characteristics of Jewish Intellectual Movements</h2>
<ul>
<li>A deep concern with furthering specific Jewish interests, such as helping Israel or promoting immigration.</li>
<li> Issues are framed in a rhetoric of universalism rather than Jewish particularism.</li>
<li>Issues are framed in moral terms, and an attitude of moral superiority pervades the movement.</li>
<li>Centered around charismatic leaders (Boas, Trotsky, Freud).</li>
<li>Jews form a cohesive, mutually reinforcing core.</li>
<li>Non-Jews appear in highly visible roles, often as spokespersons for the movement.</li>
<li>A pronounced ingroup/outgroup atmosphere within the movement—dissenters are portrayed as the personification of evil and are expunged from the movement.</li>
<li>The movement is irrational in the sense that it is fundamentally concerned with using available intellectual resources to advance a political cause.</li>
<li>The movement is associated with the most prestigious academic institutions in the society.</li>
<li>Access to prestigious and mainstream media sources, partly as a result of Jewish influence on the media.</li>
<li>Active involvement of the wider Jewish community in supporting the movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, neoconservatism also presents several problems to any analysis, the main one being that the history of neoconservatism is relatively convoluted and complex compared to other Jewish intellectual and political movements. To an unusual extent, the history of neoconservatism presents a zigzag of positions and alliances, and a multiplicity of influences. This is perhaps inevitable in a fundamentally political movement needing to adjust to changing circumstances and attempting to influence the very large, complex political culture of the United States. The main changes neoconservatives have been forced to confront have been their loss of influence in the Democratic Party and the fall of the Soviet Union. Although there is a remarkable continuity in Jewish neoconservatives' interests as Jews—the prime one being the safety and prosperity of Israel—these upheavals required new political alliances and produced a need for new work designed to reinvent the intellectual foundation of American foreign policy.</p>
<p>Neoconservatism also raises difficult problems of labeling. As described in the following, neoconservatism as a movement derives from the long association of Jews with the left. But contemporary neoconservatism is not simply a term for ex-liberals or leftists. Indeed, in its present incarnation, many second-generation neoconservatives, such as David Frum, Jonah Goldberg, and Max Boot, have never had affiliations with the American left. Rather, neoconservatism represents a fundamentally new version of American conservatism, if it can be properly termed conservative at all. By displacing traditional forms of conservatism, neoconservatism has actually solidified the hold of the left on political and cultural discourse in the United States. The deep and continuing chasm between neocons and more traditional American conservatives—a topic of this paper—indicates that this problem is far from being resolved.</p>
<p>The multiplicity of influences among neoconservatives requires some comment. The current crop of neoconservatives has at times been described as Trotskyists.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn4"" id=""ffn4"">[4]</a></sup> As will be seen, in some cases the intellectual influences of neoconservatives can be traced to Trotsky, but Trotskyism cannot be seen as a current influence within the movement. And although the political philosopher Leo Strauss is indeed a guru for some neoconservatives, his influence is by no means pervasive, and in any case provides only a very broad guide to what the neoconservatives advocate in the area of public policy. Indeed, by far the best predictor of neoconservative attitudes, on foreign policy at least, is what the political right in Israel deems is in Israel's best interests. Neoconservatism does not fit the pattern of the Jewish intellectual movements described in <em>The Culture of Critique</em>, characterized by gurus (""rabbis"") and their disciples centered around a tightly focused intellectual perspective in the manner of Freud, Boas, or Marcuse. (However, there are several subgroups of neoconservatives that fit this description, most notably those centered around Max Shachtman and Leo Strauss; see below.) Neoconservatism is better described in general as a complex interlocking professional and family network centered around Jewish publicists and organizers flexibly deployed to recruit the sympathies of both Jews and non-Jews in harnessing the wealth and power of the United States in the service of Israel. As such, neoconservatism should be considered a semicovert branch of the massive and highly effective pro-Israel lobby, which includes organizations like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)—the most powerful lobbying group in Washington—and the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA). Indeed, as discussed below, prominent neoconservatives have been associated with such overtly pro-Israel organizations as the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), and ZOA. (Acronyms of the main neoconservative and pro-Israel activist organizations used in this paper are provided in Table 2.)</p>

<p>Compared with their deep and emotionally intense commitment to Israel, neoconservative attitudes on domestic policy seem more or less an afterthought, and they will not be the main focus here. In general, neoconservatives advocate maintaining the social welfare, immigration, and civil rights policies typical of liberalism (and the wider Jewish community) up to about 1970. Some of these policies represent clear examples of Jewish ethnic strategizing—in particular, the role of the entire Jewish political spectrum and the entire organized Jewish community as the moving force behind the immigration law of 1965, which opened the floodgates to nonwhite immigration. (Jewish organizations still favor liberal immigration policies. In 2004, virtually all American Jewish public affairs agencies belong to the National Immigration Forum, the premier open borders immigration-lobbying group.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn5"" id=""ffn5"">[5]</a></sup>) Since the neocons have developed a decisive influence in the mainstream conservative movement, their support for nonrestrictive immigration policies has perhaps more significance for the future of the United States than their support for Israel.</p>
<p>As always when discussing Jewish involvement in intellectual movements, there is no implication that all or even most Jews are involved in these movements. As discussed below, the organized Jewish community shares the neocon commitment to the Likud Party in Israel. However, neoconservatism has never been a majority viewpoint in the American Jewish community, at least if being a neoconservative implies voting for the Republican Party. In the 2000 election, 80 percent of Jews voted for Al Gore.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn6"" id=""ffn6"">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>These percentages may be misleading, since it was not widely known during the 2000 election that the top advisors of George W. Bush had very powerful Jewish connections, pro-Likud sympathies, and positive attitudes toward regime change in Arab countries in the Middle East. Republican strategists are hoping for 35 percent of the Jewish vote in 2004.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn7"" id=""ffn7"">[7]</a></sup> President Bush's May 18, 2004, speech to the national convention of AIPAC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>received a wild and sustained standing ovation in response to an audience member's call for “four more years.” The majority of some 4,500 delegates at the national conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee leaped to their feet in support of the president....</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence points to a sea change among Jewish voters, who historically have trended toward the Democratic Party but may be heading to Bush's camp due to his stance on a single issue: his staunch support of Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn8"" id=""ffn8"">[8]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, Democrats may not lose many Jewish voters because John Kerry, the likely Democratic candidate, has a ""100% record"" for Israel and has promised to increase troop strength and retain the commitment to Iraq.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn9"" id=""ffn9"">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The critical issue is to determine the extent to which neoconservatism is a Jewish movement—the extent to which Jews dominate the movement and are a critical component of its success. One must then document the fact that the Jews involved in the movement have a Jewish identity and that they are Jewishly motivated—that is, that they see their participation as aimed at achieving specific Jewish goals. In the case of neoconservatives, an important line of evidence is to show their deep connections to Israel—their ""passionate attachment to a nation not their own,"" as Pat Buchanan terms it,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn10"" id=""ffn10"">[10]</a></sup> and especially to the Likud Party. As indicated above, I will argue that the main motivation for Jewish neoconservatives has been to further the cause of Israel; however, even if that statement is true, it does not imply that all Jews are neoconservatives. I therefore reject the sort of arguments made by Richard Perle, who responded to charges that neoconservatives were predominantly Jews by noting that Jews always tend to be disproportionately involved in intellectual undertakings, and that many Jews oppose the neoconservatives.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn11"" id=""ffn11"">[11]</a></sup> This is indeed the case, but leaves open the question of whether neoconservative Jews perceive their ideas as advancing Jewish interests and whether the movement itself is influential. An important point of the following, however, is that the organized Jewish community has played a critical role in the success of neoconservatism and in preventing public discussion of its Jewish roots and Jewish agendas.</p>
<h2>Non-Jewish Participation in Neoconservatism</h2>
<p>As with the other Jewish intellectual and political movements, non-Jews have been welcomed into the movement and often given highly visible roles as the public face of the movement. This of course lessens the perception that the movement is indeed a Jewish movement, and it makes excellent psychological sense to have the spokespersons for any movement resemble the people they are trying to convince. That's why Ahmed Chalabi (a Shiite Iraqi, a student of early neocon theorist Albert Wohlstetter, and a close personal associate of prominent neocons’ including Richard Perle) was the neocons' choice to lead postwar Iraq.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn12"" id=""ffn12"">[12]</a></sup> There are many examples—including Freud's famous comments on needing a non-Jew to represent psychoanalysis (he got Carl Jung for a time until Jung balked at the role, and then Ernest Jones). Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict were the most publicly recognized Boasian anthropologists, and there were a great many non-Jewish leftists and pro-immigration advocates who were promoted to visible positions in Jewish-dominated movements—and sometimes resented their role.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn13"" id=""ffn13"">[13]</a></sup> Albert Lindemann describes non-Jews among the leaders of the Bolshevik revolution as ""jewified non-Jews""—""a term, freed of its ugly connotations, [that] might be used to underline an often overlooked point: Even in Russia there were some non-Jews, whether Bolsheviks or not, who respected Jews, praised them abundantly, imitated them, cared about their welfare, and established intimate friendships or romantic liaisons with them.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn14"" id=""ffn14"">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>There was a smattering of non-Jews among the New York Intellectuals, who, as members of the anti-Stalinist left in the 1940s, were forerunners of the neoconservatives. Prominent examples were Dwight MacDonald (labeled by Michael Wreszin ""a distinguished goy among the Partisanskies”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn15"" id=""ffn15"">[15]</a></sup>—i.e., the largely Jewish <em>Partisan Review</em> crowd), James T. Farrell, and Mary McCarthy. John Dewey also had close links to the New York Intellectuals and was lavishly promoted by them;<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn16"" id=""ffn16"">[16]</a></sup> Dewey was also allied closely with his former student Sidney Hook, another major figure on the anti-Stalinist left. Dewey was a philosemite, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all, it was the Christians who made them ‘it' [i.e., victims]. Living in New York where the Jews set the standard of living from department stores to apartment houses, I often think that the Jews are the finest product of historical Christianity.... Anyway, the finest living man, so far as I know, is a Jew—[humanitarian founder of the International Institute of Agriculture] David Lubin.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn17"" id=""ffn17"">[17]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This need for the involvement of non-Jews is especially acute for neoconservatism as a political movement: Because neoconservative Jews constitute a tiny percentage of the electorate, they need to make alliances with non-Jews whose perceived interests dovetail with theirs. Non-Jews have a variety of reasons for being associated with Jewish interests, including career advancement, close personal relationships or admiration for individual Jews, and deeply held personal convictions. For example, as described below, Senator Henry Jackson, whose political ambitions were intimately bound up with the neoconservatives, was a strong philosemite due partly to his experiences in childhood; his alliance with neoconservatives also stemmed from his (entirely reasonable) belief that the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a deadly conflict and his belief that Israel was a valuable ally in that struggle. Because neoconservatives command a large and lucrative presence in the media, thinktankdom, and political culture generally, it is hardly surprising that complex blends of opportunism and personal conviction characterize participating non-Jews.</p>
<h2>University and Media Involvement</h2>
<p>An important feature of the Jewish intellectual and political movements I have studied has been their association with prestigious universities and media sources. The university most closely associated with the current crop of neoconservatives is the University of Chicago, the academic home not only of Leo Strauss, but also of Albert Wohlstetter, a mathematician turned foreign policy strategist, who was mentor to Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, both of whom have achieved power and influence in the George W. Bush administration. The University of Chicago was also home to Strauss disciple Allan Bloom, sociologist Edward Shils, and novelist Saul Bellow among the earlier generation of neoconservatives.</p>
<p>Another important academic home for the neocons has been the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. Wolfowitz spent most of the Clinton years as a professor at SAIS; the Director of the Strategic Studies Program at SAIS is Eliot Cohen, who has been a signatory to a number of the Project for a New American Century's statements and letters, including the April 2002 letter to President Bush on Israel and Iraq (see below); he is also an advisor for Frank Gaffney's Center for Security Policy, an important neocon think tank. Cohen is famous for labeling the war against terrorism World War IV. His book <em>Supreme Command</em> argues that civilian leaders should make the important decisions and not defer to military leaders. This message was understood by Cheney and Wolfowitz as underscoring the need to prevent the military from having too much influence, as in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, when Colin Powell as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been influential in opposing the removal of Saddam Hussein.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn18"" id=""ffn18"">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike other Jewish intellectual movements, the neoconservatives have been forced to deal with major opposition from within the academy, especially from Arabs and leftists in academic departments of Middle East studies. As a result, neoconservative activist groups, especially the WINEP and the MEF's Campus Watch, have monitored academic discourse and course content and organized protests against professors, and were behind congressional legislation that will mandate U.S. government monitoring of programs in Middle East studies (see below).</p>
<p>Jewish intellectual and political movements also have typically had ready access to prestigious mainstream media outlets, and this is certainly true for the neocons. Most notable are the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Commentary</em>, <em>The Public Interest</em>, Basic Books (book publishing), and the media empires of Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch owns the Fox News Channel and the <em>New York Post</em>, and is the main source of funding for Bill Kristol's <em>Weekly Standard</em>—all major neocon outlets.</p>
<p>A good example illustrating these connections is Richard Perle. Perle is listed as a Resident Fellow of the AEI, and he is on the boards of directors of the Jerusalem Post and the Hollinger Corporation, a media company controlled by Conrad Black. Hollinger owns major media properties in the United States (<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>), England (the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>), Israel (the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>), and Canada (the <em>National Post</em>); 50 percent ownership with CanWest Global Communications, which is controlled by Israel Asper and his family; CanWest has aggressively clamped down on its journalists for any deviation from its strong pro-Israel editorial policies<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn19"" id=""ffn19"">[19]</a></sup>). Hollinger also owns dozens of smaller publications in the United States, Canada, and England. All of these media outlets reflect the vigorously pro-Israel stance espoused by Perle. Perle has written op-ed columns for Hollinger newspapers as well as for the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>Neoconservatives such as Jonah Goldberg and David Frum also have a very large influence on <em>National Review</em>, formerly a bastion of traditional conservative thought in the United States. Neocon think tanks such as the AEI have a great deal of cross-membership with Jewish activist organizations such as AIPAC, the main pro-Israel lobbying organization in Washington, and the WINEP. (When President George W. Bush addressed the AEI on Iraq policy, the event was fittingly held in the Albert Wohlstetter Conference Center.) A major goal of the AEI is to maintain a high profile as pundits in the mainstream media. A short list would include AEI fellow Michael Ledeen, who is extreme even among the neocons in his lust for war against all of the Arab countries in the Middle East, is ""resident scholar in the Freedom Chair at the AEI,"" writes op-ed articles for the Scripps Howard News Service and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and appears on the Fox News Channel. Michael Rubin, visiting scholar at the AEI, writes for <em>The New Republic</em> (controlled by staunchly pro-Israel Martin Peretz), the <em>New York Times</em>, and the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. Reuel Marc Gerecht, a resident fellow at the AEI and director of the Middle East Initiative at PNAC, writes for the <em>Weekly Standard</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. Another prominent AEI member is David Wurmser, who formerly headed the Middle East Studies Program at the AEI until assuming a major role in providing intelligence disinformation in the lead-up to the war in Iraq (see below). His position at the AEI was funded by Irving Moskowitz, a wealthy supporter of the settler movement in Israel and neocon activism in the United States.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn20"" id=""ffn20"">[20]</a></sup> At the AEI Wurmser wrote op-ed pieces for the <em>Washington Times</em>, the <em>Weekly Standard</em>, and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. His book <em>Tyranny's Ally: America's Failure to Defeat Saddam Hussein</em> advocated that the United States should use military force to achieve regime change in Iraq. The book was published by the AEI in 1999 with a foreword by Richard Perle.</p>
<p>Prior to the invasion of Iraq, the <em>New York Times</em> was deeply involved in spreading deception about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorist organizations. Judith Miller's front-page articles were based on information from Iraqi defectors well known to be untrustworthy because of their own interest in toppling Saddam.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn21"" id=""ffn21"">[21]</a></sup> Many of these sources, including the notorious Ahmed Chalabi, were also touted by the Office of Special Plans of the Department of Defense, which is associated with many of the most prominent Bush administration neocons (see below). Miller's indiscretions might be chalked up to incompetence were it not for her close connections to prominent neocon organizations, in particular Daniel Pipes's Middle East Forum (MEF), which avidly sought the war in Iraq. The MEF lists Miller as an expert speaker on Middle East issues, and she has published articles in MEF media, including the <em>Middle East Quarterly</em> and the <em>MEF Wire</em>. The MEF also threw a launch party for her book on Islamic fundamentalism, <em>God Has Ninety-Nine Names</em>. Miller, whose father is ethnically Jewish, has a strong Jewish consciousness: Her book <em>One by One: Facing the Holocaust</em> ""tried to...show how each [European] country that I lived and worked in, was suppressing or distorting or politically manipulating the memory of the Holocaust.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn22"" id=""ffn22"">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> has apologized for ""coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been"" but has thus far refused to single out Miller's stories as worthy of special censure.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn23"" id=""ffn23"">[23]</a></sup> Indeed, the <em>Times</em>’s failure goes well beyond Miller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the <em>Times</em>’s coverage in the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq was credulous; much of it was inappropriately italicized by lavish front-page display and heavy-breathing headlines; and several fine articles by David Johnston, James Risen and others that provided perspective or challenged information in the faulty stories were played as quietly as a lullaby. Especially notable among these was Risen's ""C.I.A. Aides Feel Pressure in Preparing Iraqi Reports,"" which was completed several days before the invasion and unaccountably held for a week. It didn't appear until three days after the war's start, and even then was interred on Page B10.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn24"" id=""ffn24"">[24]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As is well known, the <em>New York Times</em> is Jewish-owned and has often been accused of slanting its coverage on issues of importance to Jews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn25"" id=""ffn25"">[25]</a></sup> It is perhaps another example of the legacy of Jacob Schiff, the Jewish activist/philanthropist who backed Adolph Ochs's purchase of the <em>New York Times</em> in 1896 because he believed he ""could be of great service to the Jews generally.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn26"" id=""ffn26"">[26]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Involvement of the Wider Jewish Community</h2>
<p>Another common theme of Jewish intellectual and political movements has been the involvement and clout of the wider Jewish community. While the prominent neoconservatives represent a small fraction of the American Jewish community, there is little doubt that the organized Jewish community shares their commitment to the Likud Party in Israel and, one might reasonably infer, Likud's desire to see the United States conquer and effectively control virtually the entire Arab world.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn27"" id=""ffn27"">[27]</a></sup> For example, representatives of all the major Jewish organizations serve on the executive committee of AIPAC, the most powerful lobby in Washington. Since the 1980s AIPAC has leaned toward Likud and only reluctantly went along with the Labor government of the 1990s.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn28"" id=""ffn28"">[28]</a></sup> In October 2002, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations issued a declaration of support for disarming the Iraqi regime.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn29"" id=""ffn29"">[29]</a></sup> Jack Rosen, the president of the American Jewish Congress, noted that ""the final statement ought to be crystal clear in backing the President having to take unilateral action if necessary against Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn30"" id=""ffn30"">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The organized Jewish community also plays the role of credential validator, especially for non-Jews. For example, the neocon choice for the leader of Iran following regime change is Reza Pahlavi, son of the former Shah. As is the case with Ahmed Chalabi, who was promoted by the neocons as the leader of post-Saddam Iraq, Pahlavi has proven his commitment to Jewish causes and the wider Jewish community. He has addressed the board of JINSA, given a public speech at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, met with American Jewish communal leaders, and is on friendly terms with Likud Party officials in Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn31"" id=""ffn31"">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most important, the main Jewish activist organizations have been quick to condemn those who have noted the Jewish commitments of the neoconservative activists in the Bush administration or seen the hand of the Jewish community in pushing for war against Iraq and other Arab countries. For example, the ADL's Abraham Foxman singled out Pat Buchanan, Joe Sobran, Rep. James Moran, Chris Matthews of MSNBC, James O. Goldsborough (a columnist for the <em>San Diego Union-Tribune</em>), columnist Robert Novak, and writer Ian Buruma as subscribers to ""a canard that America's going to war has little to do with disarming Saddam, but everything to do with Jews, the ‘Jewish lobby' and the hawkish Jewish members of the Bush Administration who, according to this chorus, will favor any war that benefits Israel.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn32"" id=""ffn32"">[32]</a></sup> Similarly, when Senator Ernest F. Hollings (D-SC) made a speech in the U.S. Senate and wrote a newspaper op-ed piece which claimed the war in Iraq was motivated by ""President Bush's policy to secure Israel"" and advanced by a handful of Jewish officials and opinion leaders, Abe Foxman of the ADL stated, ""when the debate veers into anti-Jewish stereotyping, it is tantamount to scapegoating and an appeal to ethnic hatred.... This is reminiscent of age-old, anti-Semitic canards about a Jewish conspiracy to control and manipulate government.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn33"" id=""ffn33"">[33]</a></sup> Despite negative comments from Jewish activist organizations, and a great deal of coverage in the American Jewish press, there were no articles on this story in any of the major U.S. national newspapers.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn34"" id=""ffn34"">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>These mainstream media and political figures stand accused of anti-Semitism—the most deadly charge that can be imagined in the contemporary world—by the most powerful Jewish activist organization in the U.S. The Simon Wiesenthal Center has also charged Buchanan and Moran with anti-Semitism for their comments on this issue.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn35"" id=""ffn35"">[35]</a></sup> While Foxman feels no need to provide any argument at all, the SWC feels it is sufficient to note that Jews have varying opinions on the war. This of course is a nonissue. The real issue is whether it is legitimate to open up to debate the question of the degree to which the neocon activists in the Bush administration are motivated by their long ties to the Likud Party in Israel and whether the organized Jewish community in the U.S. similarly supports the Likud Party and its desire to enmesh the United States in wars that are in Israel's interest. (There's not much doubt about how the SWC viewed the war with Iraq: Defense Secretary Rumsfeld invited Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Center, to briefings on the war.)<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn36"" id=""ffn36"">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Of course, neocons in the media—most notably David Frum, Max Boot, Lawrence F. Kaplan, Jonah Goldberg, and Alan Wald<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn37"" id=""ffn37"">[37]</a></sup>—have also been busy labeling their opponents ""anti-Semites.” An early example concerned a 1988 speech given by Russell Kirk at the Heritage Foundation in which he remarked that ""not seldom it has seemed as if some eminent neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of United States”— what Samuel Francis characterizes as ""a wisecrack about the slavishly pro-Israel sympathies among neoconservatives.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn38"" id=""ffn38"">[38]</a></sup> Midge Decter, a prominent neocon writer and wife of <em>Commentary</em> editor Norman Podhoretz, labeled the comment ""a bloody outrage, a piece of anti-Semitism by Kirk that impugns the loyalty of neoconservatives.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn39"" id=""ffn39"">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Accusations of anti-Semitism have become a common response to suggestions that neoconservatives have promoted the war in Iraq for the benefit of Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn40"" id=""ffn40"">[40]</a></sup> For example, Joshua Muravchik, whose ties to the neocons are elaborated below, authored an apologetic article in <em>Commentary</em> aimed at denying that neoconservative foreign policy prescriptions are tailored to benefit Israel and that imputations to that effect amount to ""anti-Semitism.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn41"" id=""ffn41"">[41]</a></sup> These accusations are notable for uniformly failing to honestly address the Jewish motivations and commitments of neoconservatives (see below). Finally, the wider Jewish community provides financial support for intellectual and political movements, as in the case of psychoanalysis, where the Jewish community signed on as patients and as consumers of psychoanalytic literature.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn42"" id=""ffn42"">[42]</a></sup> This has also been the case with neoconservatism, as noted by Gary North:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With respect to the close connection between Jews and neoconservatism, it is worth citing [Robert] Nisbet's assessment of the revival of his academic career after 1965. His only book, <em>The Quest for Community</em> (Oxford UP, 1953), had come back into print in paperback in 1962 as <em>Community and Power</em>. He then began to write for the neoconservative journals. Immediately, there were contracts for him to write a series of books on conservatism, history, and culture, beginning with <em>The Sociological Tradition</em>, published in 1966 by Basic Books, the newly created neoconservative publishing house. Sometime in the late 1960's, he told me: ""I became an in-house sociologist for the <em>Commentary</em>-<em>Public Interest</em> crowd. Jews buy lots of academic books in America.” Some things are obvious but unstated. He could follow the money: book royalties. So could his publishers.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn43"" id=""ffn43"">[43]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The support of the wider Jewish community and the elaborate neoconservative infrastructure in the media and thinktankdom provide irresistible professional opportunities for Jews and non-Jews alike. I am not saying that people like Nisbet don't believe what they write in neoconservative publications. I am simply saying that having opinions that are attractive to neoconservatives can be very lucrative and professionally rewarding.</p>
<p>In the following I will first trace the historical roots of neoconservatism. This is followed by portraits of several important neoconservatives that focus on their Jewish identities and their connections to pro-Israel activism.</p>
<h2>Historical Roots of Neoconservatism<br/>Coming to Neoconservatism from the Far Left</h2>
<p>All twentieth century Jewish intellectual and political movements stem from the deep involvement of Jews with the left. However, beginning in the late 1920s, when the followers of Leon Trotsky broke off from the mainstream communist movement, the Jewish left has not been unified. By all accounts the major figure linking Trotsky and the neoconservative movement is Max Shachtman, a Jew born in Poland in 1904 but brought to the United States as an infant. Like other leftists during the 1920s, Shachtman was enthusiastic about the Soviet Union, writing in 1923 that it was ""a brilliant red light in the darkness of capitalist gloom.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn44"" id=""ffn44"">[44]</a></sup> Shachtman began as a follower of James P. Cannon,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn45"" id=""ffn45"">[45]</a></sup> who became converted to Trotsky's view that the Soviet Union should actively foment revolution.</p>
<p>The Trotskyist movement had a Jewish milieu as Shachtman attracted young Jewish disciples—the familiar rabbi/disciple model of Jewish intellectual movements: ""Youngsters around Shachtman made little effort to hide their New York background or intellectual skills and tastes. Years later they could still hear Shachtman's voice in one another's speeches.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn46"" id=""ffn46"">[46]</a></sup> To a much greater extent than the Communist Party, which was much larger and was committed to following the Soviet line, the Trotskyists survived as a small group centered around charismatic leaders like Shachtman, who paid homage to the famous Trotsky, who lurked in the background as an exile from the USSR living in Mexico. In the Jewish milieu of the movement, Shachtman was much admired as a speaker because of his ability in debate and in polemics. He became the quintessential rabbinical guru—the leader of a close, psychologically intense group: ""He would hug them and kiss [his followers]. He would pinch both their cheeks, hard, in a habit that some felt blended sadism and affection.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn47"" id=""ffn47"">[47]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Trotskyists took seriously the Marxist idea that the proletarian socialist revolution should occur first in the economically advanced societies of the West rather than in backward Russia or China. They also thought that a revolution only in Russia was doomed to failure because the success of socialism in Russia depended inevitably on the world economy. The conclusion of this line of logic was that Marxists should advocate a permanent revolution that would sweep away capitalism completely rather than concentrate on building socialism in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Shachtman broke with Trotsky over defense of the Soviet Union in World War II, setting out to develop his own brand of ""third camp Marxism” that followed James Burnham in stressing internal democracy and analyzing the USSR as ""bureaucratic collectivism.” In 1939-1941, Shachtman battled leftist intellectuals like Sidney Hook, Max Eastman, and Dwight Macdonald, who were rejecting not only Stalinism but also Trotskyism as insufficiently open and democratic; they also saw Trotsky himself as guilty of some of the worst excesses of the early Bolshevik regime, especially his banning of opposition parties and his actions in crushing the Kronstadt sailors, who had called for democracy. Shachtman defended an open, democratic version of Marxism but was concerned that his critics were abandoning socialism—throwing out the baby with the bathwater.</p>
<p>Hook, Eastman, Burnham, and Macdonald therefore constituted a ""rightist” force within the anti-Stalinist left; it is this force that may with greater accuracy be labeled as one of the immediate intellectual ancestors of neoconservatism. By 1940, Macdonald was Shachtman's only link to the <em>Partisan Review</em> crowd of the New York Intellectuals—another predominantly Jewish group—and the link became tenuous. James Burnham also broke with Shachtman in 1940. By 1941 Burnham rejected Stalinism, fascism, and even the New Deal as bureaucratic menaces, staking out a position characterized by ""juridical defense, his criticism of managerial political tendencies, and his own defence of liberty,”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn48"" id=""ffn48"">[48]</a></sup> eventually becoming a fixture at <em>National Review</em> in the decades before it became a neoconservative journal.</p>
<p>Shachtman himself became a Cold Warrior and social democrat in the late 1940s, attempting to build an all-inclusive left while his erstwhile Trotskyist allies in the Fourth International were bent on continuing their isolation in separate factions on the left. During this period, Shachtman saw the Stalinist takeover in Eastern Europe as a far greater threat than U.S. power, a prelude to his support for the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the U.S. role in Vietnam. By the 1950s he rejected revolutionary socialism and stopped calling himself a Trotskyist;<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn49"" id=""ffn49"">[49]</a></sup> during the 1960s he saw the Democratic Party as the path to social democracy, while nevertheless retaining some commitment to Marxism and socialism. ""Though he would insist for the rest of his life that he had found the keys to Marxism in his era, he was recutting the keys as he went along. In the early 1950s he had spoken, written, and acted as a left-wing, though no longer revolutionary, socialist. By the late 1950s he moved into the mainstream of U.S. social democracy”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn50"" id=""ffn50"">[50]</a></sup> with a strategy of pushing big business and white Southerners out of the Democratic Party (the converse of Nixon's ""Southern strategy"" for the Republican Party). In the 1960s ""he suggested more openly than ever before that U.S. power could be used to promote democracy in the third world”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn51"" id=""ffn51"">[51]</a></sup>—a view that aligns him with later neoconservatives.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Michael Harrington, author of the influential <em>The Other America</em>, became the best known Shachtmanite, but they diverged when Harrington showed more sympathy toward the emerging multicultural, antiwar, feminist, ""New Politics"" influence in the Democratic Party while Shachtman remained committed to the Democrats as the party of organized labor and anti-communism.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn52"" id=""ffn52"">[52]</a></sup> Shachtman became an enemy of the New Left, which he saw as overly apologetic toward the Soviet Union. ""As I watch the New Left, I simply weep. If somebody set out to take the errors and stupidities of the Old Left and multiplied them to the nth degree, you would have the New Left of today.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn53"" id=""ffn53"">[53]</a></sup> This was linked to disagreements with Irving Howe, editor of <em>Dissent</em>, who published a wide range of authors, including Harrington, although Shachtman followers Carl Gershman and Tom Kahn remained on the editorial board of <em>Dissent</em> until 1971-1972.</p>
<p>The main link between Shachtman and the political mainstream was the influence he and his followers had on the AFL-CIO. In 1972, shortly before his death, Shachtman, ""as an open anti-communist and supporter of both the Vietnam War and Zionism,”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn54"" id=""ffn54"">[54]</a></sup> backed Senator Henry Jackson in the Democratic presidential primary. Jackson was a strong supporter of Israel (see below), and by this time support for Israel had ""become a litmus test for Shachtmanites.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn55"" id=""ffn55"">[55]</a></sup> Jackson, who was closely associated with the AFL-CIO, hired Tom Kahn, who had become a Shachtman follower in the 1950s. Kahn was executive secretary of the Shachtmanite League for Industrial Democracy, headed at the time by Michael Harrington, and he was also the head of the Department of International Affairs of the AFL-CIO, where he was an ""obsessive promoter of Israel”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn56"" id=""ffn56"">[56]</a></sup> to the point that the AFL-CIO became the world's largest non-Jewish holder of Israel bonds. His department had a budget of around $40 million, most of which was provided by the federally funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED).<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn57"" id=""ffn57"">[57]</a></sup> During the Reagan administration, the AFL-CIO received approximately 40 percent of available funding from the NED, while no other funded group received more than 10 percent. That imbalance has prompted speculation that NED is effectively in the hands of the Social Democrats USA—Shachtman's political heir (see below)—the membership of which today includes both NED president Carl Gershman and a number of AFL-CIO officials involved with the endowment.</p>
<p>In 1972, under the leadership of Carl Gershman and the Shachtmanites, the Socialist Party USA changed its name to Social Democrats USA.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn58"" id=""ffn58"">[58]</a></sup> Working with Jackson, SD/ USA's members achieved little political power because of the dominance of the New Politics wing of the Democratic Party, with its strong New Left influence from the 1960s. With the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, however, key figures from SD/USA achieved positions of power and influence both in the labor movement and in the government. Among the latter were Reagan-era appointees such as United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliott Abrams (son-in-law of Podhoretz and Decter), Geneva arms talks negotiator Max Kampelman (aide to Hubert Humphrey and founding member of JINSA; he remains on its advisory board), and Gershman, who was an aide to UN Ambassador Kirkpatrick and head of the NED.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn59"" id=""ffn59"">[59]</a></sup> Other Shachtmanites in the Reagan administration included Joshua Muravchik, a member of SD/USA's National Committee, who wrote articles defending Reagan's foreign policy, and Penn Kemble, an SD/USA vice-chairman, who headed Prodemca, an influential lobbying group for the Contra opponents of the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Abrams and Muravchik have continued to play an important role in neocon circles in the George W. Bush administration (see below). In addition to being associated with SD/USA,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn60"" id=""ffn60"">[60]</a></sup> Kirkpatrick has strong neocon credentials. She is on the JINSA Board and is a senior fellow at the AEI. She also has received several awards from Jewish organizations, including the Defender of Israel Award [New York], given to non-Jews who stand up for the Jewish people (other neocon recipients include Henry Jackson and Bayard Rustin), the Humanitarian Award of B'nai B'rith, and the 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Award from the prime minister of Israel (1998).<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn61"" id=""ffn61"">[61]</a></sup> Kirkpatrick's late husband Evron was a promoter of Hubert Humphrey and long-time collaborator of neocon godfather Irving Kristol.</p>
<p>During the Reagan Administration, Lane Kirkland, the head of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, was also a Shachtmanite and an officer of the SD/USA. As secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO during the 1970s, Kirkland was a member of the Committee on the Present Danger, a group of neoconservatives in which ""prominent Jackson supporters, advisers, and admirers from both sides of the aisle predominated.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn62"" id=""ffn62"">[62]</a></sup> Kirkland gave a eulogy at Henry Jackson's funeral. Kirkland was not a Jew but was married to a Jew and, like Jackson, had very close ties to Jews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout his career Kirkland maintained a special affection for the struggle of the Jews. It may be the result of his marriage to Irena [nee Neumann in 1973—his second marriage], a Czech survivor of the Holocaust and an inspiring figure in her own right. Or it may be because he recognized...that the cause of the Jews and the cause of labor have been inseparable.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn63"" id=""ffn63"">[63]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carl Gershman remains head of the NED, which supports the U.S.-led invasion and nation-building effort in Iraq.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn64"" id=""ffn64"">[64]</a></sup> The general line of the NED is that Arab countries should ""get over"" the Arab-Israeli conflict and embrace democracy, Israel, and the United States. In reporting on talks with representatives of the Jewish community in Turkey, Gershman frames the issues in terms of ending anti-Semitism in Turkey by destroying Al Qaeda; there is no criticism of the role of Israel and its policies in producing hatred throughout the region.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn65"" id=""ffn65"">[65]</a></sup> During the 1980s, the NED supported nonviolent strategies to end apartheid in South Africa in association with the A. Philip Randolph Institute, headed by longtime civil rights activist and SD/USA neocon Bayard Rustin.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn66"" id=""ffn66"">[66]</a></sup> Critics of the NED, such as Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex), have complained that the NED ""is nothing more than a costly program that takes U.S. taxpayer funds to promote favored politicians and political parties abroad.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn67"" id=""ffn67"">[67]</a></sup> Paul suggests that the NED's support of former communists reflects Gershman's leftist background.</p>
<p>In general, at the present time SD/USA continues to support organized labor domestically and to take an active interest in using U.S. power to spread democracy abroad. A resolution of January 2003 stated that the main conflict in the world was not between Islam and the West but between democratic and nondemocratic governments, with Israel being the only democracy in the Middle East.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn68"" id=""ffn68"">[68]</a></sup> The SD/USA strongly supports democratic nation building in Iraq.</p>
<p>A prominent member of SD/USA is Joshua Muravchik. A member of the SD/USA National Advisory Council, Muravchik is also a member of the advisory board of JINSA, a resident scholar at the AEI, and an adjunct scholar at WINEP. His book <em>Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism</em><sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn69"" id=""ffn69"">[69]</a></sup> views socialism critically, but advocates a reformist social democracy that falls short of socialism; he views socialism as a failed religion that is relatively poor at creating wealth and is incompatible with very powerful human desires for private ownership.</p>
<p>Another prominent member of SD/USA is Max Kampelman, whose article, posted on the SD/USA website, makes the standard neoconservative complaints about the UN dating from the 1970s, especially regarding its treatment of Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1964,...the U.N. Security Council has passed 88 resolutions against Israel—the only democracy in the area—and the General Assembly has passed more than 400 such resolutions, including one in 1975 declaring ""Zionism as a form of racism.” When the terrorist leader of the Palestinians, Arafat, spoke in 1974 to the General Assembly, he did so wearing a pistol on his hip and received a standing ovation. While totalitarian and repressive regimes are eligible and do serve on the U.N. Security Council, democratic Israel is barred by U.N. rules from serving in that senior body.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn70"" id=""ffn70"">[70]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Neoconservatives As a Continuation of Cold War Liberalism's ""Vital Center""</h2>
<p>The other strand that merged into neoconservatism stems from Cold War liberalism, which became dominant within the Democratic Party during the Truman administration. It remained dominant until the rise of the New Politics influence in the party during the 1960s, culminating in the presidential nomination of George McGovern in 1972.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn71"" id=""ffn71"">[71]</a></sup> In the late 1940s, a key organization was Americans for Democratic Action, associated with such figures as Reinhold Niebuhr, Hubert Humphrey, and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., whose book <em>The Vital Center</em> (1947) distilled a liberal anticommunist perspective which combined vigorous containment of communism with ""the struggle within our country against oppression and stagnation.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn72"" id=""ffn72"">[72]</a></sup> This general perspective was also evident in the Congress for Cultural Freedom, whose central figure was Sidney Hook.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn73"" id=""ffn73"">[73]</a></sup> The CCF was a group of anticommunist intellectuals organized in 1950 and funded by the CIA, and included a number of prominent liberals, such as Schlesinger. A new wrinkle, in comparison to earlier Jewish intellectual and political movements discussed in <em>Culture of Critique</em>, has been that the central figures, Norman Podhoretz and Irving Kristol, have operated not so much as intellectual gurus in the manner of Freud or Boas or even Shachtman, but more as promoters and publicists of views which they saw as advancing Jewish interests. Podhoretz's <em>Commentary</em> (published by the American Jewish Committee) and Kristol's <em>The Public Interest</em> became clearinghouses for neoconservative ideas, but many of the articles were written by people with strong academic credentials. For example, in the area of foreign policy Robert W. Tucker and Walter Laqueur appeared in these journals as critics of liberal foreign policy.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn74"" id=""ffn74"">[74]</a></sup> Their work updated the anticommunist tradition of the ""vital center"" by taking account of Western weakness apparent in the New Politics liberalism of the Democratic Party and the American left, as well as the anti-Western posturing of the third world.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn75"" id=""ffn75"">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>This ""vital center"" intellectual framework typified key neoconservatives at the origin of the movement in the late 1960s, including the two most pivotal figures, Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz. In the area of foreign policy, a primary concern of Jewish neo-conservatives from the 1960s-1980s was the safety and prosperity of Israel, at a time when the Soviet Union was seen as hostile to Jews within its borders and was making alliances with Arab regimes against Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As they saw it, the world was gravely threatened by a totalitarian Soviet Union with aggressive outposts around the world and a Third World corrupted by vicious anti-Semitism.... A major project of Moynihan, Kirkpatrick, and other neoconservatives in and out of government was the defense of Israel.... By the mid-1970s, Israel was also under fire from the Soviet Union and the Third World and much of the West. The United States was the one exception, and the neoconservatives—stressing that Israel was a just, democratic state constantly threatened by vicious and aggressive neighbors—sought to deepen and strengthen this support.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn76"" id=""ffn76"">[76]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irving Kristol is quite frank in his view that the United States should support Israel even if it is not in its national interest to do so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Large nations, whose identity is ideological, like the Soviet Union of yesteryear and the United States of today, inevitably have ideological interests in addition to more material concerns.... That is why we feel it necessary to defend Israel today, when its survival is threatened. No complicated geopolitical calculations of national interest are necessary.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn77"" id=""ffn77"">[77]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A watershed event in neoconservatism was the statement of November 1975 by UN Ambassador Daniel P. Moynihan in response to the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism. Moynihan, whose work in the UN made him a neocon icon and soon a senator from New York,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn78"" id=""ffn78"">[78]</a></sup> argued against the ""discredited"" notion that ""there are significant biological differences among clearly identifiable groups, and that these differences establish, in effect, different levels of humanity.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn79"" id=""ffn79"">[79]</a></sup> (In this regard Moynihan may not have been entirely candid, since he appears to have been much impressed by Arthur Jensen's research on race differences in intelligence. As an advisor to President Nixon on domestic affairs, one of Moynihan's jobs was to keep Nixon abreast of Jensen's research.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn80"" id=""ffn80"">[80]</a></sup>) In his UN speech, Moynihan ascribed the idea that Jews are a race to theorists like Houston Stewart Chamberlain, whose motivation was to find ""new justifications...for excluding and persecuting Jews"" in an era in which religious ideology was losing its power to do so. Moynihan describes Zionism as a ""National Liberation Movement,"" but one with no genetic basis: ""Zionists defined themselves merely as Jews, and declared to be Jewish anyone born of a Jewish mother or—and this is the absolutely crucial fact—anyone who converted to Judaism.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn81"" id=""ffn81"">[81]</a></sup> Moynihan describes the Zionist movement as composed of a wide range of ""racial stocks"" (quotation marks in original)—""black Jews, brown Jews, white Jews, Jews from the Orient and Jews from the West.""</p>
<p>Obviously, there is much to disagree with in these ideas. Jewish racial theorists, among them Zionists like Arthur Ruppin and Vladimir Jabotinsky (the hero of the Likud Party throughout its history), were in the forefront of racial theorizing about Jews from the late nineteenth century onwards.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn82"" id=""ffn82"">[82]</a></sup> And there is a great deal of evidence that Jews, including most notably Orthodox and Conservative Jews and much of the settler movement that constitutes the vanguard of Zionism today, have been and continue to be vitally interested in maintaining their ethnic integrity.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn83"" id=""ffn83"">[83]</a></sup> (Indeed, as discussed below, Elliott Abrams has been a prominent neoconservative voice in favor of Jews marrying Jews and retaining their ethnic cohesion.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Moynihan's speech is revealing in its depiction of Judaism as unconcerned about its ethnic cohesion, and for its denial of the biological reality of race. In general, neoconservatives have been staunch promoters of the racial zeitgeist of post-WWII liberal America. Indeed, as typical Cold War liberals up to the end of the 1960s, many of the older neocons were in the forefront of the racial revolution in the United States. It is also noteworthy that Moynihan's UN speech is typical of the large apologetic literature by Jewish activists and intellectuals in response to the ""Zionism is racism"" resolution, of which <em>The Myth of the Jewish Race</em> by Raphael Patai and Jennifer Patai is perhaps the best-known example.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn84"" id=""ffn84"">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>The flagship neoconservative magazine <em>Commentary</em>, under the editorship of Norman Podhoretz, has published many articles defending Israel. Ruth Wisse's 1981 <em>Commentary</em> article ""The Delegitimation of Israel"" is described by Mark Gerson as ""perhaps the best expression"" of the neoconservative view that Israel ""was a just, democratic state constantly threatened by vicious and aggressive neighbors.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn85"" id=""ffn85"">[85]</a></sup> Wisse views hostility toward Israel as another example of the long history of anti-Jewish rhetoric that seeks to delegitimize Judaism.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn86"" id=""ffn86"">[86]</a></sup> This tradition is said to have begun with the Christian beliefs that Jews ought to be relegated to an inferior position because they had rejected Christ. This tradition culminated in twentieth century Europe in hatred directed at secular Jews because of their failure to assimilate completely to European culture. The result was the Holocaust, which was ""from the standpoint of its perpetrators and collaborators successful beyond belief.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn87"" id=""ffn87"">[87]</a></sup> Israel, then, is an attempt at normalization in which Jews would be just another country fending for itself and seeking stability; it ""should [also] have been the end of anti-Semitism, and the Jews may in any case be pardoned for feeling that they had earned a moment of rest in history.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn88"" id=""ffn88"">[88]</a></sup> But the Arab countries never accepted the legitimacy of Israel, not only with their wars against the Jewish state, but also by the ""Zionism as racism"" UN resolution, which ""institutionalized anti-Semitism in international politics.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn89"" id=""ffn89"">[89]</a></sup> Wisse criticizes <em>New York Times</em> columnist Anthony Lewis for criticizing Israeli policies while failing to similarly criticize Arab states that fail to embody Western ideals of freedom of expression and respect for minority rights. Wisse also faults certain American Jewish organizations and liberal Jews for criticizing the policies of the government of Menachem Begin.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn90"" id=""ffn90"">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>The article stands out for its cartoonish view that the history of anti-Jewish attitudes can be explained with broad generalizations according to which the behavior and attitudes of Jews are completely irrelevant for understanding the history of anti-Semitism. The message of the article is that Jews as innocent victims of the irrational hatred of Europeans have a claim for ""a respite"" from history that Arabs are bound to honor by allowing the dispossession of the Palestinians. The article is also a testimony to the sea change among American Jews in their support for the Likud Party and its expansionist policies in Israel. Since Wisse's article appeared in 1981, the positive attitudes toward the Likud Party characteristic of the neoconservatives have become the mainstream view of the organized American Jewish community, and the liberal Jewish critics attacked by Wisse have been relegated to the fringe of the American Jewish community.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn91"" id=""ffn91"">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the area of domestic policy, Jewish neoconservatives were motivated by concerns that the radicalism of the New Left (many of whom were Jews) compromised Jewish interests as a highly intelligent, upwardly mobile group. Although Jews were major allies of blacks in the civil rights movement, by the late 1960s many Jews bitterly opposed black efforts at community control of schools in New York, because they threatened Jewish hegemony in the educational system, including the teachers' union.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn92"" id=""ffn92"">[92]</a></sup> Black-Jewish interests also diverged when affirmative action and quotas for black college admission became a divisive issue in the 1970s.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn93"" id=""ffn93"">[93]</a></sup> It was not only neoconservatives who worried about affirmative action: The main Jewish activist groups—the AJCommittee, the AJCongress, and the ADL—sided with Bakke in a landmark case on racial quota systems in the University of California—Davis medical school, thereby promoting their own interests as a highly intelligent minority living in a meritocracy.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn94"" id=""ffn94"">[94]</a></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, some neoconservatives, despite their record of youthful radicalism and support for the civil rights movement, began to see Jewish interests as bound up with those of the middle class. As Nathan Glazer noted in 1969, commenting on black anti-Semitism and the murderous urges of the New Left toward the middle class:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti-Semitism is only part of this whole syndrome, for if the members of the middle class do not deserve to hold onto their property, their positions, or even their lives, then certainly the Jews, the most middle-class of all, are going to be placed at the head of the column marked for liquidation.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn95"" id=""ffn95"">[95]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The New Left also tended to have negative attitudes toward Israel, with the result that many Jewish radicals eventually abandoned the left. In the late 1960s, the black Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee described Zionism as ""racist colonialism”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn96"" id=""ffn96"">[96]</a></sup> which massacred and oppressed Arabs. In Jewish eyes, a great many black leaders, including Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Toure), Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, and Andrew Young, were seen as entirely too pro-Palestinian. (Young lost his position as UN ambassador because he engaged in secret negotiations with the Palestinians.) During the 1960s, expressions of solidarity with the Palestinians by radical blacks, some of whom had adopted the Muslim religion, became a focus of neoconservative ire and resulted in many Jewish New Leftists leaving the movement.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn97"" id=""ffn97"">[97]</a></sup> Besides radical blacks, other New Left figures, such as I. F. Stone and Noam Chomsky (both Jews), also criticized Israel and were perceived by neocons as taking a pro-Soviet line.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn98"" id=""ffn98"">[98]</a></sup> The origins of neoconservatism as a Jewish movement are thus linked to the fact that the left, including the Soviet Union and leftist radicals in the United States, had become anti-Zionist.</p>
<p>In 1970, Podhoretz transformed <em>Commentary</em> into a weapon against the New Left.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn99"" id=""ffn99"">[99]</a></sup> In December of that year <em>National Review</em> began, warily at first, to welcome neocons into the conservative tent, stating in 1971, ""We will be delighted when the new realism manifested in these articles is applied by <em>Commentary</em> to the full range of national and international issues.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn100"" id=""ffn100"">[100]</a></sup> Irving Kristol supported Nixon in 1972 and became a Republican about ten years before most neocons made the switch. Nevertheless, even in the 1990s the neocons ""continued to be distinct from traditional Midwestern and southern conservatives for their northeastern roots, combative style, and secularism”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn101"" id=""ffn101"">[101]</a></sup>—all ways of saying that neoconservatism retained its fundamentally Jewish milieu.</p>
<p>The fault lines between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives were apparent during the Reagan administration in the battle over the appointment of the head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, eventually won by the neoconservative Bill Bennett. The campaign featured smear tactics and innuendo aimed at M. E. Bradford, an academic literary critic and defender of Southern agrarian culture who was favored by traditional conservatives. After neocons accused him of being a ""virulent racist” and an admirer of Hitler, Bradford was eventually rejected as a potential liability to the administration.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn102"" id=""ffn102"">[102]</a></sup></p>
<p>The entry of the neoconservatives into the conservative mainstream did not, therefore, proceed without a struggle. Samuel Francis witnessed much of the early infighting among conservatives, won eventually by the neocons. Francis recounts the ""catalog of neoconservative efforts not merely to debate, criticize, and refute the ideas of traditional conservatism but to denounce, vilify, and harm the careers of those Old Right figures and institutions they have targeted.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn103"" id=""ffn103"">[103]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are countless stories of how neoconservatives have succeeded in entering conservative institutions, forcing out or demoting traditional conservatives, and changing the positions and philosophy of such institutions in neoconservative directions.... Writers like M. E. Bradford, Joseph Sobran, Pat Buchanan, and Russell Kirk, and institutions like <em>Chronicles</em>, the Rockford Institute, the Philadelphia Society, and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute have been among the most respected and distinguished names in American conservatism. The dedication of their neoconservative enemies to driving them out of the movement they have taken over and demonizing them as marginal and dangerous figures has no legitimate basis in reality. It is clear evidence of the ulterior aspirations of those behind neoconservatism to dominate and subvert American conservatism from its original purposes and agenda and turn it to other purposes.... What neoconservatives really dislike about their ""allies"" among traditional conservatives is simply the fact that the conservatives are conservatives at all—that they support ""this notion of a Christian civilization,"" as Midge Decter put it, that they oppose mass immigration, that they criticize Martin Luther King and reject the racial dispossession of white Western culture, that they support or approve of Joe McCarthy, that they entertain doubts or strong disagreement over American foreign policy in the Middle East, that they oppose reckless involvement in foreign wars and foreign entanglements, and that, in company with the Founding Fathers of the United States, they reject the concept of a pure democracy and the belief that the United States is or should evolve toward it.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn104"" id=""ffn104"">[104]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most notably, neoconservatives have been staunch supporters of arguably the most destructive force associated with the left in the twentieth century—massive non-European immigration. Support for massive non-European immigration has spanned the Jewish political spectrum throughout the twentieth century to the present. A principal motivation of the organized Jewish community for encouraging such immigration has involved a deeply felt animosity toward the people and culture responsible for the immigration restriction of 1924-1965—""this notion of a Christian civilization.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn105"" id=""ffn105"">[105]</a></sup> As neoconservative Ben Wattenberg has famously written, ""The non-Europeanization of America is heartening news of an almost transcendental quality.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn106"" id=""ffn106"">[106]</a></sup> The only exception—thus far without any influence—is that since 9/11 some Jewish activists, including neoconservative Daniel Pipes, head of the MEF, and Stephen Steinlight, senior fellow of the American Jewish Committee, have opposed Muslim—and only Muslim—immigration because of possible effects on pro-Israel sentiment in the U.S.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn107"" id=""ffn107"">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>In general, neoconservatives have been far more attached to Jewish interests, and especially the interests of Israel, than to any other identifiable interest. It is revealing that as the war in Iraq has become an expensive quagmire in both lives and money, Bill Kristol has become willing to abandon the neoconservatives' alliance with traditional conservatives by allying with John Kerry and the Democratic Party. This is because Kerry has promised to increase troop strength and retain the commitment to Iraq, and because Kerry has declared that he has ""a 100 percent record—not a 99, a 100 percent record—of sustaining the special relationship and friendship that we have with Israel.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn108"" id=""ffn108"">[108]</a></sup> As Pat Buchanan notes, the fact that John Kerry ""backs partial birth abortion, quotas, raising taxes, homosexual unions, liberals on the Supreme Court and has a voting record to the left of Teddy Kennedy"" is less important than his stand on the fundamental issue of a foreign policy that is in the interest of Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn109"" id=""ffn109"">[109]</a></sup></p>
<h2>The Fall of Henry Jackson and the Rise of Neoconservatism in the Republican Party</h2>
<p>The neoconservative takeover of the Republican Party and of American conservatism in general would have been unnecessary had not the Democratic Party shifted markedly to the left in the late 1960s. Henry Jackson is the pivotal figure in the defection of the neocons from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party—the person whose political fortunes most determined the later trajectory of neoconservatism. Jackson embodied the political attitudes and ambitions of a Jewish political network that saw Jewish interests as combining traditionally liberal social policies of the civil rights and Great Society era (but stopping short of advocating quota-type affirmative action policies or minority ethnic nationalism) with a Cold War posture that was at once aggressively pro-Israel and anticommunist at a time when the Soviet Union was perceived as the most powerful enemy of Israel. This ""Cold War liberal” faction was dominant in the Democratic Party until 1972 and the nomination of George McGovern. After the defeat of McGovern, the neoconservatives founded the Committee for a Democratic Majority, whose attempt to resuscitate the Cold War coalition of the Democratic Party had a strong representation of Shachtmanite labor leaders as well as people centered around Podhoretz's <em>Commentary</em>: Podhoretz; Ben Wattenberg (who wrote speeches for Hubert Humphrey and was an aide to Jackson); Midge Decter; Max Kampelman (see above); Penn Kemble of the SD/USA; Jeane Kirkpatrick (who began writing for <em>Commentary</em> during this period); sociologists Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer, and Seymour Martin Lipset; Michael Novak; Soviet expert Richard Pipes; and Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Nevertheless, ""by the end of 1974, the neoconservatives appeared to have reached a political dead end. As guardians of vital center liberalism, they had become a minority faction within the Democratic Party, unable to do more than protest the party's leftward drift.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn110"" id=""ffn110"">[110]</a></sup></p>
<p>The basic story line is that after failing again in 1976 and 1980 to gain the presidential nomination for a candidate who represented their views, this largely Jewish segment of political activists—now known as neoconservatives—switched allegiance to the Republican Party. The neocons had considerable influence in the Reagan years but less in the George H. W. Bush administration, only to become a critically important force in the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration where, in the absence of a threat from the Soviet Union, neoconservatives have attempted to use the power of the United States to fundamentally alter the political landscape of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Henry Jackson was an ideal vehicle for this role as champion of Jewish interests. He was a very conscious philosemite: ""My mother was a Christian who believed in a strong Judaism. She taught me to respect the Jews, help the Jews! It was a lesson I never forgot.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn111"" id=""ffn111"">[111]</a></sup> Jackson also had very positive personal experiences with Jews during his youth. During his college years he was the beneficiary of generosity from a Jew who allowed him to use a car to commute to college, and he developed lifelong friendships with two Jews, Stan Golub and Paul Friedlander. He was also horrified after seeing Buchenwald, the WWII German concentration camp, an experience that made him more determined to help Israel and Jews.</p>
<p>Entering Congress in 1940, Jackson was a strong supporter of Israel from its beginnings in 1948. By the 1970s he was widely viewed as Israel's best friend in Congress: ""Jackson's devotion to Israel made Nixon and Kissinger's look tepid.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn112"" id=""ffn112"">[112]</a></sup> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment linking U.S.-Soviet trade to the ability of Jews to emigrate from the Soviet Union was passed over strenuous opposition from the Nixon administration. And despite developing a reputation as the ""Senator from Boeing,"" Jackson opposed the sale of Boeing-made AWACS to Saudi Arabia because of the possibility that they might harm the interests of Israel.</p>
<p>Jackson's experience of the Depression made him a liberal, deeply empathetic toward the suffering that was so common during the period. He defined himself as ""vigilantly internationalist and anticommunist abroad but statist at home, committed to realizing the New Deal—Fair Deal vision of a strong, active federal government presiding over the economy, preserving and enhancing welfare protection, and extending civil rights.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn113"" id=""ffn113"">[113]</a></sup> These attitudes of Jackson, and particularly his attitudes on foreign policy, brought him into the orbit of Jewish neoconservatives who held similar attitudes on domestic issues and whose attitudes on foreign policy stemmed fundamentally from their devotion to the cause of Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackson's visceral anticommunism and antitotalitarianism...brought him into the orbit of Jewish neoconservatives despite the subtle but important distinction in their outlook. The senator viewed the threat to Israel as a manifestation of the totalitarian threat he considered paramount. Some neoconservatives viewed Soviet totalitarianism as the threat to Israel they considered paramount.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn114"" id=""ffn114"">[114]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jackson had developed close ties with a number of neocons who would later become important. Richard Perle was Jackson's most important national security advisor between 1969 and 1979, and Jackson maintained close relations with Paul Wolfowitz, who began his career in Washington working with Perle in Jackson's office. Jackson employed Perle even after credible evidence surfaced that he had spied for Israel: An FBI wiretap on the Israeli Embassy revealed Perle discussing classified information that had been supplied to him by someone on the National Security Council staff, presumably Helmut (""Hal"") Sonnenfeldt. (Sonnenfeldt, who was Jewish, ""was known from previous wiretaps to have close ties to the Israelis as well as to Perle.... [He] had been repeatedly investigated by the FBI for other suspected leaks early in his career.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn115"" id=""ffn115"">[115]</a></sup>) As indicated below, several prominent neocons have been investigated on credible charges of spying for Israel: Perle, Wolfowitz, Stephen Bryen, Douglas Feith, and Michael Ledeen. Neocon Frank Gaffney, the non-Jewish president of the CSP, a neocon think tank, was also a Jackson aide. Jackson was also close to Bernard Lewis of Princeton University; Lewis is a Jewish expert on the Middle East who has had an important influence on the neocons in the George W. Bush administration as well as close ties to Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn116"" id=""ffn116"">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1970s Jackson was involved with two of the most important neocon groups of the period. In 1976 he convened Team B, headed by Richard Pipes (a Harvard University Soviet expert), and including Paul Nitze, Wolfowitz, and Seymour Weiss (former director of the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs). Albert Wohlstetter, who was Wolfowitz's Ph.D. advisor at the University of Chicago, was a major catalyst for Team B. Jackson was also close to the Committee on the Present Danger. Formed in November 1976, the committee was a Who's Who of Jackson supporters, advisors, confidants, and admirers from both the Democratic and Republican parties, and included several members associated with the SD/USA: Paul Nitze, Eugene Rostow, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, Max Kampelman, Lane Kirkland, Richard Pipes, Seymour Martin Lipset, Bayard Rustin, and Norman Podhoretz. CPD was a sort of halfway house for Democratic neocons sliding toward the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The result was that all the important neocons backed Jackson for president in 1972 and 1976. Jackson commanded a great deal of financial support from the Jewish community in Hollywood and elsewhere because of his strong support for Israel, but he failed to win the 1976 Democratic nomination, despite having more money than his rivals. After Jackson's defeat and the ascendance of the leftist tendencies of the Carter administration, many of Jackson's allies went to work for Reagan with Jackson's tacit approval, with the result that they were frozen out of the Democratic Party once Carter was defeated.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn117"" id=""ffn117"">[117]</a></sup> A large part of the disillusionment of Jackson and his followers stemmed from the Carter administration's attitude toward Israel. Carter alienated American Jews by his proposals for a more evenhanded policy toward Israel, in which Israel would return to its 1967 borders in exchange for peace with the Arabs. Jews were also concerned because of the Andrew Young incident. (Young, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN and an African American, had been fired after failing to disclose to the State Department details of his unauthorized meeting with representatives of the Palestinians. Blacks charged that Jews were responsible for Young's firing.)</p>
<p>In October 1977 the Carter administration, in a joint communiqué with the Soviet Union, suggested Israel pull back to the 1967 borders: ""Jackson joined the ferocious attack on the administration that ensued from devotees of Kissinger's incremental approach and from Israel's supporters in the United States. He continued to regard unswerving U.S. support for Israel as not only a moral but a strategic imperative, and to insist that the maintenance of a strong, secure, militarily powerful Israel impeded rather than facilitated Soviet penetration of the Middle East.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn118"" id=""ffn118"">[118]</a></sup> Jackson was particularly fond of pointing to maps of Israel showing how narrow Israel's borders had been before its 1967 conquests. For his part, Carter threatened to ask the American people ""to choose between those who supported the national interest and those who supported a foreign interest such as Israel.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn119"" id=""ffn119"">[119]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There was one last attempt to mend the fences between the neocons and the Democrats, a 1980 White House meeting between Carter and major neocons, including Jeane Kirkpatrick, Norman Podhoretz, Midge Decter, Ben Wattenberg, Elliott Abrams (aide to neocon favorite Patrick Moynihan<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn120"" id=""ffn120"">[120]</a></sup>), Max Kampelman, and Penn Kemble. The meeting, which discussed attitudes toward the USSR, did not go well, and ""henceforth, their disdain for Carter and dislike of Kennedy would impel the neoconservatives to turn away from the Democratic Party and vote for Reagan.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn121"" id=""ffn121"">[121]</a></sup> “They had hoped to find a new Truman to rally around, a Democrat to promote their liberal ideas at home while fighting the cold war abroad. Not finding one, they embraced the Republican party and Ronald Reagan as the best alternative.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn122"" id=""ffn122"">[122]</a></sup></p>
<p>Perle left Jackson's office in March 1980 to go into business with John F. Lehman (Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administration and, as of this writing [2004] a member of the panel investigating the events of 9/11). Quite a few neocons assumed positions in the Reagan administration in the area of defense and foreign policy: Kirkpatrick as UN ambassador (Kirkpatrick hired Joshua Muravchik, Kenneth Adelman, and Carl Gershman as deputies); Perle as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy (Perle hired Frank Gaffney and Douglas Feith); Elliott Abrams as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Affairs; Max Kampelman as U.S. ambassador to the Helsinki human rights conference and later as chief U.S. arms negotiator; Wolfowitz as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian affairs. Another Jewish neocon, Richard Pipes, was influential in putting together a paper on grand strategy toward the USSR. Nevertheless, Reagan kept the neocons at arm's length and ceased heeding their advice. He favored developing trust and confidence with Soviet leaders rather than escalating tensions by threats of aggressive action.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn123"" id=""ffn123"">[123]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bill Clinton courted neocons who had defected to Reagan. Perle, Kirkpatrick, and Abrams remained Republicans, but thirty-three ""moderate and neoconservative foreign policy experts"" endorsed Clinton in 1992, including Nitze, Kemble, and Muravchik, although Muravchik and several others later repudiated their endorsement, saying that Clinton had returned to the left liberal foreign policy of the Democrats since McGovern.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn124"" id=""ffn124"">[124]</a></sup> Ben Wattenberg and Robert Strauss remained Democrats ""who have not written off the Jackson tradition in their own party.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn125"" id=""ffn125"">[125]</a></sup> Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Democrat's 2000 vice presidential nominee, is the heir to this tradition.</p>
<h2>Responding to the Fall of the Soviet Union</h2>
<p>With the end of the Cold War, neoconservatives at first advocated a reduced role for the U.S., but this stance switched gradually to the view that U.S. interests required the vigorous promotion of democracy in the rest of the world.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn126"" id=""ffn126"">[126]</a></sup> This aggressively pro-democracy theme, which appears first in the writings of Charles Krauthammer and then those of Elliott Abrams,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn127"" id=""ffn127"">[127]</a></sup> eventually became an incessant drumbeat in the campaign for the war in Iraq. Krauthammer also broached the now familiar themes of unilateral intervention, and he emphasized the danger that smaller states could develop weapons of mass destruction which could be used to threaten world security.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn128"" id=""ffn128"">[128]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A cynic would argue that this newfound interest in democracy was tailor-made as a program for advancing the interests of Israel. After all, Israel is advertised as the only democracy in the Middle East, and democracy has a certain emotional appeal for the United States, which has at times engaged in an idealistic foreign policy aimed at furthering the cause of human rights in other countries. It is ironic that during the Cold War the standard neocon criticism of President Carter's foreign policy was that it was overly sensitive to human rights in countries that were opposed to the Soviet Union and insufficiently condemnatory of the human rights policies of the Soviet Union. The classic expression of this view was Jeane Kirkpatrick's 1979 <em>Commentary</em> article, ""Dictatorships and Double Standards.” In an essay that would have been excellent reading prior to the invasion of Iraq, Kirkpatrick noted that in many countries political power is tied to complex family and kinship networks resistant to modernization. Nevertheless, ""no idea holds greater sway in the mind of educated Americans than the belief that it is possible to democratize governments, anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn129"" id=""ffn129"">[129]</a></sup> Democracies are said to make heavy demands on citizens in terms of participation and restraint, and developing democracies is the work of ""decades, if not centuries.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn130"" id=""ffn130"">[130]</a></sup> My view is that democracy is a component of the uniquely Western suite of traits deriving from the evolution of Western peoples and their cultural history: monogamy, simple family structure, individual rights against the state, representative government, moral universalism, and science.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn131"" id=""ffn131"">[131]</a></sup> This social structure cannot easily be exported to other societies, and particularly to Middle Eastern societies whose traditional cultures exhibit traits opposite to these.</p>
<p>It is revealing that, while neocons generally lost interest in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe after these areas were no longer points of contention in the Cold War, there was no lessening of interest in the Middle East.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn132"" id=""ffn132"">[132]</a></sup> Indeed, neoconservatives and Jews in general failed to support President George H. W. Bush when, in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, his administration pressured Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians and resisted a proposal for $10 billion in loan guarantees for Israel. This occurred in the context of Secretary of State James A. Baker's famous comment, ""Fuck the Jews. They didn't vote for us.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn133"" id=""ffn133"">[133]</a></sup> </p>
<h2>Neoconservative Portraits</h2>
<p>As with the other Jewish intellectual movements I have studied, neoconservatives have a history of mutual admiration, close, mutually supportive personal, professional, and familial relationships, and focused cooperation in pursuit of common goals. For example, Norman Podhoretz, the former editor of <em>Commentary</em>, is the father of John Podhoretz, a neoconservative editor and columnist. Norman Podhoretz is also the father-in-law of Elliott Abrams, the former head of the Ethics and Public Policy Center (a neoconservative think tank) and the director of Near Eastern affairs at the National Security Council. Norman's wife, Midge Decter, recently published a hagiographic biography of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, whose number-two and number-three deputies at the Pentagon, respectively, are Wolfowitz and Feith. Perle is a fellow at the AEI.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn134"" id=""ffn134"">[134]</a></sup> He originally helped Wolfowitz obtain a job with the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1973. In 1982, Perle, as Deputy Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, hired Feith for a position as his Special Counsel, and then as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Negotiations Policy. In 2001, Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz helped Feith obtain an appointment as Undersecretary for Policy. Feith then appointed Perle as chairman of the Defense Policy Board. This is only the tip of a very large iceberg.</p>
<h3>Leo Strauss</h3>
<p>Leo Strauss is an important influence on several important neoconservatives, particularly Irving and Bill Kristol. Strauss was a classicist and political philosopher at the University of Chicago. He had a very strong Jewish identity and viewed his philosophy as a means of ensuring Jewish survival in the Diaspora.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn135"" id=""ffn135"">[135]</a></sup> As Strauss himself noted, ""I believe I can say, without any exaggeration, that since a very, very early time the main theme of my reflections has been what is called the ‘Jewish Question.'“<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn136"" id=""ffn136"">[136]</a></sup></p>
<p>Much of Strauss's early writing was on Jewish issues, and a constant theme in his writing was the idea that Western civilization was the product of the ""energizing tension"" between Athens and Jerusalem—Greek rationalism and the Jewish emphasis on faith, revelation, and religious intensity.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn137"" id=""ffn137"">[137]</a></sup> Although Strauss believed that religion had effects on non-Jews that benefited Jews, there is little doubt that Strauss viewed religious fervor as an indispensable element of Jewish commitment and group loyalty—ethnocentrism by any other name:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some great love and loyalty to the Jewish people are in evidence in the life and works of Strauss.... Strauss <em>was</em> a good Jew. He knew the dignity and worth of love of one's own. Love of the good, which is the same as love of the truth, is higher than love of one's own, but there is only one road to the truth, and it leads through love of one's own. Strauss showed his loyalty to things Jewish in a way he was uniquely qualified to do, by showing generations of students how to treat Jewish texts with the utmost care and devotion. In this way he turned a number of his Jewish students in the direction of becoming better Jews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn138"" id=""ffn138"">[138]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strauss believed that liberal, individualistic modern Western societies were best for Judaism because the illiberal alternatives of both the left (communism) and right (Nazism) were anti-Jewish. (By the 1950s, anti-Semitism had become an important force in the Soviet Union.) However, Strauss believed that liberal societies were not ideal because they tended to break down group loyalties and group distinctiveness—both qualities essential to the survival of Judaism. And he thought that there is a danger that, like the Weimar Republic, liberal societies could give way to fascism, especially if traditional religious and cultural forms were overturned; hence the neoconservative attitude that traditional religious forms among non-Jews are good for Jews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn139"" id=""ffn139"">[139]</a></sup> (Although Strauss believed in the importance of Israel for Jewish survival, his philosophy is not a defense of Israel but a blueprint for Jewish survival in a Diaspora in Western societies.)</p>
<p>The fate of the Weimar Republic, combined with the emergence of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, had a formative influence on his thinking. As Stephen Holmes writes, ""Strauss made his young Jewish-American students gulp by informing them that toleration [secular humanism] was dangerous and that the Enlightenment—rather than the failure of the Enlightenment—led directly to Adolph Hitler.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn140"" id=""ffn140"">[140]</a></sup> Hitler was also at the center of Strauss's admiration for Churchill—hence the roots of the neocon cult of Churchill: ""The tyrant stood at the pinnacle of his power. The contrast between the indomitable and magnanimous statesman and the insane tyrant—this spectacle in its clear simplicity was one of the greatest lessons which men can learn, at any time.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn141"" id=""ffn141"">[141]</a></sup> I suspect that, given Strauss's strong Jewish identity, a very large part of his admiration of Churchill was not that Churchill opposed tyrants, but that he went to war against an anti-Jewish tyrant at enormous cost to his own people and nation while allied with another tyrant, Joseph Stalin, who had by 1939 already murdered far more people than Hitler ever would.</p>
<p>Strauss has become a cult figure—the quintessential rabbinical guru, with devoted disciples such as Allan Bloom.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn142"" id=""ffn142"">[142]</a></sup> Strauss relished his role as a guru to worshiping disciples, once writing of ""the love of the mature philosopher for the puppies of his race, by whom he wants to be loved in turn.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn143"" id=""ffn143"">[143]</a></sup> In turn, Strauss was a disciple of Hermann Cohen, a philosopher at the University of Marburg, who ended his career teaching in a rabbinical school; Cohen was a central figure in a school of neo-Kantian intellectuals whose main concern was to rationalize Jewish nonassimilation into German society.</p>
<p>Strauss understood that inequalities among humans were inevitable and advocated rule by an aristocratic elite of philosopher kings forced to pay lip service to the traditional religious and political beliefs of the masses while not believing them.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn144"" id=""ffn144"">[144]</a></sup> This elite should pursue its vision of the common good but must reach out to others using deception and manipulation to achieve its goals. As Bill Kristol has described it, elites have the duty to guide public opinion, but ""one of the main teachings [of Strauss] is that all politics are limited and none of them is really based on the truth.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn145"" id=""ffn145"">[145]</a></sup> Amore cynical characterization is provided by Stephen Holmes: ""The good society, on this model, consists of the sedated masses, the gentlemen rulers, the promising puppies, and the philosophers who pursue knowledge, manipulate the gentlemen, anesthetize the people, and housebreak the most talented young”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn146"" id=""ffn146"">[146]</a></sup>—a comment that sounds to me like an alarmingly accurate description of the present situation in the United States and elsewhere in the Western world. Given Strauss's central concern that an acceptable political order be compatible with Jewish survival, it is reasonable to assume that Strauss believed that the aristocracy would serve Jewish interests.</p>
<p>Strauss's philosophy is not really conservative. The rule by an aristocratic elite would require a complete political transformation in order to create a society that was ""as just as possible"":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing short of a <em>total transformation</em> of imbedded custom must be undertaken. To secure this inversion of the traditional hierarchies, the political, social and educational system must be subjected to a radical reformation. For justice to be possible the founders have to ""wipe clean the dispositions of men,"" that is, justice is possible only if the city and its citizens are <em>not</em> what they <em>are</em>: the weakest [i.e., the philosophic elite] is supposed to rule the strongest [the masses], the irrational is supposed to submit to the rule of the rational.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn147"" id=""ffn147"">[147]</a></sup> [emphasis in original]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strauss described the need for an external <em>exoteric</em> language directed at outsiders, and an internal <em>esoteric</em> language directed at ingroup members.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn148"" id=""ffn148"">[148]</a></sup> A general feature of the movements I have studied is that this Straussian prescription has been followed: Issues are framed in language that appeals to non-Jews rather than explicitly in terms of Jewish interests, although Jewish interests always remain in the background if one cares to look a little deeper. The most common rhetoric used by Jewish intellectual and political movements has been the language of moral universalism and the language of science—languages that appeal to the educated elites of the modern Western world.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn149"" id=""ffn149"">[149]</a></sup> But beneath the rhetoric it is easy to find statements describing the Jewish agendas of the principal actors. And the language of moral universalism (e.g., advocating democracy as a universal moral imperative) goes hand in hand with a narrow Jewish moral particularism (altering governments that represent a danger to Israel).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy in this respect that the split between the leftist critics of Strauss like Shadia Drury and Stephen Holmes versus Strauss disciples like Allan Bloom and Harry V. Jaffa comes down to whether Strauss is properly seen as a universalist. The leftist critics claim that the moral universalism espoused by Strauss's disciples is nothing more than a veneer for his vision of a hierarchical society based on manipulation of the masses. As noted, the use of a universalist rhetoric to mask particularist causes has a long history among Jewish intellectual and political movements, and it fits well with Strauss's famous emphasis on esoteric messages embedded in the texts of great thinkers. Moreover, there is at least some textual support for the leftist critique, although there can never be certainty because of the intentionally enigmatic nature of Strauss's writings.</p>
<p>I am merely adding to the leftist critique the idea that Strauss crafted his vision of an aristocratic elite manipulating the masses as a Jewish survival strategy. In doing so, I am taking seriously Strauss's own characterization of his work as centrally motivated by ""the Jewish question"" and by the excellent evidence for his strong commitment to the continuity of the Jewish people. At a fundamental level, based on my scholarship on Jewish intellectual and political movements, one cannot understand Strauss's well-attested standing as a Jewish guru—as an exemplar of the familiar pattern of an intellectual leader in the manner of Boas or Freud surrounded by devoted Jewish disciples —<em>unless he had a specifically Jewish message</em>.</p>
<p>The simple logic is as follows: Based on the data presented here, it is quite clear that Strauss understood that neither communism nor fascism was good for Jews in the long run. But democracy cannot be trusted given that Weimar ended with Hitler. A solution is to advocate democracy and the trappings of traditional religious culture, but managed by an elite able to manipulate the masses via control of the media and academic discourse. Jews have a long history as an elite in Western societies, so it is not in the least surprising that Strauss would advocate an ideal society in which Jews would be a central component of the elite. In my view, this is Strauss's esoteric message. The exoteric message is the universalist veneer promulgated by Strauss's disciples—a common enough pattern among Jewish intellectual and political movements.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if one accepts at face value the view of Strauss's disciples that he should be understood as a theorist of egalitarianism and democracy, then Strauss's legacy becomes just another form of leftism, and a rather undistinguished one at that. In this version, the United States is seen as a ""proposition nation"" committed only to the ideals of democracy and egalitarianism—an ideology that originated with Jewish leftist intellectuals like Horace Kallen.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn150"" id=""ffn150"">[150]</a></sup> Such an ideology not only fails to protect the ethnic interests of European Americans in maintaining their culture and demographic dominance, it fails as an adequate survival strategy for Jews because of the possibility that, like Weimar Germany, the United States could be democratically transformed into a state that self-consciously opposes the ethnic interests of Jews.</p>
<p>The most reasonable interpretation is that neocons see Strauss's moral universalism as a powerful exoteric ideology. The ideology is powerful among non-Jews because of the strong roots of democracy and egalitarianism in American history and in the history of the West; it is attractive to Jews because it has no ethnic content and is therefore useful in combating the ethnic interests of European Americans—its function for the Jewish left throughout the twentieth century.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn151"" id=""ffn151"">[151]</a></sup> But without the esoteric message that the proposition nation must be managed and manipulated by a covert, Jewish-dominated elite, such an ideology is inherently unstable and cannot be guaranteed to meet the long-term interests of Jews.</p>
<p>And one must remember that the neocons' public commitment to egalitarianism belies their own status as an elite who were educated at elite academic institutions and created an elite network at the highest levels of the government. They form an elite that is deeply involved in deception, manipulation, and espionage on issues related to Israel and the war in Iraq. They also established the massive neocon infrastructure in the elite media and think tanks. And they have often become wealthy in the process. Their public pronouncements advocating a democratic, egalitarian ideology have not prevented them from having strong ethnic identities and a strong sense of their own ethnic interests; nor have their public pronouncements supporting the Enlightenment ideals of egalitarianism and democracy prevented them from having a thoroughly anti-Enlightenment ethnic particularist commitment to the most nationalistic, aggressive, racialist elements within Israel—the Likud Party, the settler movement, and the religious fanatics. At the end of the day, the only alternative to the existence of an esoteric Straussian message along the lines described here is massive self-deception.</p>
<h3>Sidney Hook</h3>
<p>Born in 1902, Sidney Hook was an important leader of the anti-Stalinist, non-Trotskyist left. Hook's career is interesting because he illustrates an evolution toward neoconservatism that was in many ways parallel to the Shachtmanites. Indeed, Hook ended up as honorary chairman of the SD/USA during the 1980s.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn152"" id=""ffn152"">[152]</a></sup> Hook became a socialist at a time when virtually all socialists supported the Bolshevik revolution as the only alternative to the anti-Jewish government of the tsar.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn153"" id=""ffn153"">[153]</a></sup> As a professional philosopher, he saw his role as an attempt to develop an intellectually respectable Marxism strengthened with Dewey's ideas. But until the Moscow Trials of the 1930s he was blind to the violence and oppression in the USSR. During a visit to the USSR in 1929, ""I was completely oblivious at the time to the systematic repressions that were then going on against noncommunist elements and altogether ignorant of the liquidation of the so-called kulaks that had already begun that summer. I was not even curious enough to probe and pry, possibly for fear of what I would discover.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn154"" id=""ffn154"">[154]</a></sup> During the 1930s, when the Communist Party exercised a dominant cultural influence in the United States, ""the fear of fascism helped to blur our vision and blunt our hearing to the reports that kept trickling out of the Soviet Union.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn155"" id=""ffn155"">[155]</a></sup> Even the Moscow Trials were dismissed by large sectors of liberal opinion. It was the time of the Popular Front, where the fundamental principle was the defense of the Soviet Union. Liberal journals like <em>The New Republic</em> did not support inquiries into the trials, citing <em>New York Times</em> reporter Walter Duranty as an authority who believed in the truth of the confessions.</p>
<p>Unlike the Shachtmanites, Hook never accepted Trotsky because of his record of defending ""every act of the Soviet regime, until he himself lost power.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn156"" id=""ffn156"">[156]</a></sup> “To the very end Trotsky remained a blind, pitiless (even when pitiable) giant, defending the right of the minority vanguard of the proletariat—the Party—to exercise its dictatorship over ‘the backward layers of the proletariat'—i.e., those who disagreed with the self-designated vanguard.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn157"" id=""ffn157"">[157]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hook became a leader of the anti-Stalinist left in the 1930s and during the Cold War, usually with John Dewey as the most visible public persona in various organizations dedicated to opposing intellectual thought control. His main issue came to be openness versus totalitarianism rather than capitalism versus socialism. Like other neoconservatives, from the 1960s on he opposed the excesses of the New Left, including affirmative action. Sidney Hook received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan. Like many neoconservatives, he never abandoned many of his leftist views: In his acceptance speech, Hook stated that he was ""an unreconstructed believer in the welfare state, steeply progressive income tax, a secular humanist,” and pro-choice on abortion.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn158"" id=""ffn158"">[158]</a></sup> Sounding much like SD/USA stalwart Joshua Muravchik,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn159"" id=""ffn159"">[159]</a></sup> Hook noted that socialists like himself ""never took the problem of incentives seriously enough.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn160"" id=""ffn160"">[160]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like Strauss, Hook's advocacy of the open society stemmed from his belief that such societies were far better for Judaism than either the totalitarian left or right. Hook had a strong Jewish identification: He was a Zionist, a strong supporter of Israel, and an advocate of Jewish education for Jewish children.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn161"" id=""ffn161"">[161]</a></sup> Hook developed an elaborate apologia for Judaism and against anti-Semitism in the modern world,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn162"" id=""ffn162"">[162]</a></sup> and he was deeply concerned about the emergence of anti-Semitism in the USSR.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn163"" id=""ffn163"">[163]</a></sup> The ideal society is thus culturally diverse and democratic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No philosophy of Jewish life is required except one—identical with the democratic way of life—which enables Jews who for any reason at all accept their existence as Jews to lead a dignified and significant life, a life in which together with their fellowmen they strive collectively to improve the quality of democratic, secular cultures and thus encourage a maximum of cultural diversity, both Jewish and non-Jewish.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn164"" id=""ffn164"">[164]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Stephen Bryen</h3>
<p>Despite his low profile in the George W. Bush administration, Stephen Bryen is an important neocon. Bryen served as executive director of JINSA from 1979 to 1981 and remains on its advisory board. He is also affiliated with the AEI and the CSP. Richard Perle hired Bryen as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Reagan administration. At the Pentagon, Perle and Bryen led an effort to extend and strengthen the Export Administration Act to grant the Pentagon a major role in technology transfer policy. This policy worked to the benefit of Israel at the expense of Europe, as Israel alone had access to the most secret technology designs.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn165"" id=""ffn165"">[165]</a></sup> In 1988 Bryen and Perle temporarily received permission to export sensitive klystron technology, used in antiballistic missiles, to Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two senior colleagues in DOD [the Department of Defense] who wish to remain anonymous have confirmed that this attempt by Bryen to obtain klystrons for his friends was not unusual, and was in fact “standard operating procedure” for him, recalling numerous instances when U.S. companies were denied licenses to export sensitive technology, only to learn later that Israeli companies subsequently exported similar (U.S. derived) weapons and technology to the intended customers/governments.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn166"" id=""ffn166"">[166]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is surprising that Perle was able to hire Bryen at all given that, beginning in 1978, Bryen was investigated for offering classified documents to the Mossad station chief of the Israeli embassy in the presence of an AIPAC representative.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn167"" id=""ffn167"">[167]</a></sup> Bryen's fingerprints were found on the documents in question despite his denials that he had ever had the documents in his possession. (Bryen refused to take a polygraph test.) The Bryen investigation was ultimately shut down because of the failure of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to grant access to the Justice Department to files important to the investigation, and because of the decision by Philip Heymann, the chief of the Justice Department's Criminal Division and later Deputy Attorney General in the Clinton Administration, to drop the case.</p>
<p>Heymann is Jewish and had a close relationship with Bryen's lawyer, Nathan Lewin. Heymann's Jewish consciousness can be seen from the fact that he participated in the campaign to free Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard and expunge his record—a major effort by a great many Jewish organizations and Jewish activists such as Alan Dershowitz. There were reports that Heymann was attempting to bypass Attorney General Janet Reno by preparing a Justice Department recommendation for presidential clemency, and that Heymann's behavior may have been a factor in his resignation shortly thereafter.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn168"" id=""ffn168"">[168]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this history of covert pro-Israeli activism, in 2001 Bryen was appointed, at the urging of Paul Wolfowitz, to the China Commission, which monitors illicit technology transfers to China, a position that requires top secret security clearance.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn169"" id=""ffn169"">[169]</a></sup> Many of the illicit technology transfers investigated by the commission are thought to have occurred via Israel.</p>
<h3>Charles Krauthammer</h3>
<p>In his 1995 book, John Ehrman regards Charles Krauthammer as a key neoconservative foreign policy analyst because Krauthammer was on the cutting edge of neocon thinking on how to respond to the unipolar world created by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Krauthammer has consistently urged that the United States pursue a policy to remake the entire Arab world—a view that represents the ""party line"" among neoconservatives (e.g., Michael Ledeen, Norman Podhoretz, Bill Kristol, David Frum, and Richard Perle<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn170"" id=""ffn170"">[170]</a></sup>). In a speech at the AEI in February 2004, Krauthammer argued for a unilateral confrontation with the entire Arab-Muslim world (and nowhere else) in the interests of ""democratic globalism."" He advocated a U.S. foreign policy that is not ""tied down"" by ""multilateralism"": ""the whole point of the multilateral enterprise: To reduce American freedom of action by making it subservient to, dependent on, constricted by the will—and interests—of other nations. To tie down Gulliver with a thousand strings. To domesticate the most undomesticated, most outsized, national interest on the planet—ours.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn171"" id=""ffn171"">[171]</a></sup> Democratic globalism is aimed at winning the struggle with the Arab-Islamic world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond power. Beyond interest. Beyond interest defined as power. That is the credo of democratic globalism. Which explains its political appeal: America is a nation uniquely built not on blood, race or consanguinity, but on a proposition—to which its sacred honor has been pledged for two centuries....</p>
<p>Today, post-9/11, we find ourselves in an...existential struggle but with a different enemy: not Soviet communism, but Arab-Islamic totalitarianism, both secular and religious.... </p>
<p>[D]emocratic globalism is an improvement over realism. What it can teach realism is that the spread of democracy is not just an end but a means, an indispensable means for securing American interests. The reason is simple. Democracies are inherently more friendly to the United States, less belligerent to their neighbors, and generally more inclined to peace. Realists are right that to protect your interests you often have to go around the world bashing bad guys over the head. But that technique, no matter how satisfying, has its limits. At some point, you have to implant something, something organic and self-developing. And that something is democracy.</p>
<p>But where? The danger of democratic globalism is its universalism, its open-ended commitment to human freedom, its temptation to plant the flag of democracy everywhere. It must learn to say no. And indeed, it does say no. But when it says no to Liberia, or Congo, or Burma, or countenances alliances with authoritarian rulers in places like Pakistan or, for that matter, Russia, it stands accused of hypocrisy. Which is why we must articulate criteria for saying yes...I propose a single criterion: where it counts....</p>
<p>And this is its axiom: <em>We will support democracy everywhere, but we will commit blood and treasure only in places where there is a strategic necessity—meaning, places central to the larger war against the existential enemy, the enemy that poses a global mortal threat to freedom.</em></p>
<p>Where does it count today? Where the overthrow of radicalism and the beginnings of democracy can have a decisive effect in the war against the new global threat to freedom, the new existential enemy, the Arab-Islamic totalitarianism that has threatened us in both its secular and religious forms for the quarter-century since the Khomeini revolution of 1979....</p>
<p>There is not a single, remotely plausible, alternative strategy for attacking the monster behind 9/11. It's not Osama bin Laden; it is the cauldron of political oppression, religious intolerance, and social ruin in the Arab-Islamic world—oppression transmuted and deflected by regimes with no legitimacy into virulent, murderous anti-Americanism. It's not one man; it is a condition.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn172"" id=""ffn172"">[172]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Krauthammer is a Jew and his Jewish identification and pro-Israel motivation are typical of Jewish neoconservatives, as is his obeisance to the idea that America is a proposition nation, rather than a nation founded by a particular ethnic group—an ethno-cultural creation of Western Europe that should attempt to preserve this heritage. The same attitude can be seen in Irving Kristol's comment that the United States is an ""ideological nation"" committed to defend Israel independent of national interest (see above). This ideology was the creation of leftist Jewish intellectuals attempting to rationalize a multicultural America in which European-Americans were just one of many cultural/ethnic groups.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn173"" id=""ffn173"">[173]</a></sup></p>
<p>He is a regular columnist for the <em>Jerusalem Post</em> and has written extensively in support of hard-line policies in Israel and on what he interprets as a rise in age-old anti-Jewish attitudes in Europe. In 2002 Krauthammer was presented with Bar-Ilan University's annual Guardian of Zion Award at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. His acceptance speech reveals an observant Jew who is steeped in Jewish history and the Hebrew tradition. The 1993 Oslo Accords are termed ""the most catastrophic and self-inflicted wound by any state in modern history""; this disastrous policy was based on ""an extreme expression of post-Zionistic messianism.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn174"" id=""ffn174"">[174]</a></sup> Krauthammer rejected the ""secular messianism"" of Shimon Peres as more dangerous than the religious messianism of Gush Emunim (a prominent settler group with a message of Jewish racialism and a vision of a ""Greater Israel"" encompassing the lands promised to Abraham in Genesis—from the Nile to the Euphrates<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn175"" id=""ffn175"">[175]</a></sup>) or of certain followers of the Lubavitcher Rebbe because of its impact on shaping contemporary Jewish history.</p>
<p>Krauthammer is also deeply concerned with anti-Semitism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is odd is not the anti-Semitism of today [in Europe], but its relative absence during the last half-century. That was the historical anomaly. Holocaust shame kept the demon corked for that half-century. But now the atonement is passed. The genie is out again. This time, however, it is more sophisticated. It is not a blanket hatred of Jews. Jews can be tolerated, even accepted, but they must know their place. Jews are fine so long as they are powerless, passive and picturesque. What is intolerable is Jewish assertiveness, the Jewish refusal to accept victimhood. And nothing so embodies that as the Jewish state.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn176"" id=""ffn176"">[176]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another barometer of Jewish identification is Krauthammer's take on Mel Gibson's <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>. In sentiments similar to those of many other Jewish activists and writers, he terms it a ""blood libel,"" ""a singular act of interreligious aggression,"" a ""spectacularly vicious"" personal interpretation.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn177"" id=""ffn177"">[177]</a></sup> Gibson's interpretations ""point overwhelmingly in a single direction—to the villainy and culpability of the Jews."" The crucifixion is ""a history of centuries of relentless, and at times savage, persecution of Jews in Christian lands.” One gets the impression of a writer searching as best he can to find the most extreme terms possible to express his loathing of Gibson's account of the Christian gospel.</p>
<h3>Paul Wolfowitz</h3>
<p>Paul Wolfowitz's background indicates a strong Jewish identity. His father Jacob was a committed Zionist throughout his life and in his later years organized protests against Soviet treatment of Jews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn178"" id=""ffn178"">[178]</a></sup> Jacob was deeply concerned about the Holocaust,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn179"" id=""ffn179"">[179]</a></sup> and, in his own reminiscences of his teenage years, Paul recalls reading books about the Holocaust and traveling to Israel when his father was a visiting professor at an Israeli university. Wolfowitz reads Hebrew, and his sister married an Israeli and lives in Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn180"" id=""ffn180"">[180]</a></sup> At the University of Chicago the professors mentioned in his account of the period are all Jewish:<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn181"" id=""ffn181"">[181]</a></sup> Albert Wohlstetter, his Ph.D. advisor; Leo Strauss (Wolfowitz's original intent when enrolling at the University of Chicago was to study with Strauss, and he ended up taking two courses from him); Strauss's disciple Alan Bloom, whose <em>Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students</em> (1987) is a neocon classic; and Saul Bellow, the novelist.</p>
<p>Also indicative of a strong Jewish identity is a conversation Wolfowitz had with Natan Sharansky, Israeli cabinet minister and leader of a right wing, pro-settlement political party, at a conference on Middle East policy in Aspen, Colorado, in 2002. The conference was arranged by Richard Perle under the auspices of the AEI. Wolfowitz and Sharansky walked to a reception, because the latter, as an observant Jew, could not drive on the Sabbath. Sharansky noted that the walk ""gave us a chance to talk about everything—Arafat, international terrorism, Iraq and Iran and, of course, Jewish history, our roots and so on.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn182"" id=""ffn182"">[182]</a></sup> Wolfowitz is married to Clare Selgin, and they have three children, Sara, David, and Rachel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn183"" id=""ffn183"">[183]</a></sup> </p>
<p><em>Ravelstein</em> is Bellow's fictionalized but essentially accurate description of Alan Bloom and his circle at the University of Chicago.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn184"" id=""ffn184"">[184]</a></sup> It is of some interest because it recreates the Jewish atmosphere of Wolfowitz's academic environment. Wolfowitz was a member of Bloom's circle at Cornell University and chose the University of Chicago for his graduate training because of the presence there of Leo Strauss, most likely at the urging of Bloom. Wolfowitz and Bloom maintained a close relationship after Bloom moved to the University of Chicago and during Wolfowitz's later career in the government. Wolfowitz was one of the ""favored students” of Bloom described in Robert Locke's comment that ""Favored students of the usually haughty Bloom were gradually introduced to greater and greater intimacies with the master, culminating in exclusive dinner parties with him and Saul [Bellow] in Bloom's lavishly furnished million-dollar apartment.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn185"" id=""ffn185"">[185]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As depicted by Bellow, Bloom emerges as the quintessential guru, surrounded by disciples—a ""father” who attempts not only to direct his disciples' careers but their personal lives as well.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn186"" id=""ffn186"">[186]</a></sup> His disciples are described as ""clones who dressed as he did, smoked the same Marlboros”; they were heading toward ""the Promised Land of the intellect toward which Ravelstein, their Moses and their Socrates, led them.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn187"" id=""ffn187"">[187]</a></sup> “To be cut off from his informants in Washington and Paris, from his students, the people he had trained, the band of brothers, the initiates, the happy few made him extremely uncomfortable.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn188"" id=""ffn188"">[188]</a></sup> Bloom in turn is depicted as a ""disciple” of the Strauss character, Felix Davarr: ""Ravelstein talked so much about him that in the end I was obliged to read some of his books. It had to be done if I was to understand what [Ravelstein] was all about.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn189"" id=""ffn189"">[189]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bloom's Ravelstein is depicted as very self-consciously Jewish. A theme is the contrast between ""crude” Jewish behavior and genteel WASP behavior—a theme described beautifully and authoritatively in the writings of John Murray Cuddihy.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn190"" id=""ffn190"">[190]</a></sup> And there is the acute consciousness of who is a Jew and who isn't; all of Ravelstein's close friends are Jews. There is an intense interest in whether non-Jews dislike Jews or have connections to fascism. And there is a fixation on the Holocaust and when it will happen again: ""They kill more than half of the European Jews...There's no telling which corner it will come from next.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn191"" id=""ffn191"">[191]</a></sup> Ravelstein thought of Jews as displacing WASPs: He ""liked to think of living in one of the tony flat buildings formerly occupied by the exclusively WASP faculty.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn192"" id=""ffn192"">[192]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following Strauss, Bloom thought of Western civilization as the product of Athens and Jerusalem, and is said to have preferred the former, at least until the end of his life, when Jerusalem loomed large: Bellow's narrator writes, ""I could see [Ravelstein/Bloom] was following a trail of Jewish ideas or Jewish essences. It was unusual for him these days, in any conversation, to mention even Plato or Thucydides. He was full of Scripture now”—all connected to ""the great evil,” the belief during the World War II era ""that almost everybody agreed that the Jews had no right to live...a vast collective agreement that the world would be improved by their disappearance and their extinction.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn193"" id=""ffn193"">[193]</a></sup> Ravelstein's conclusion is that ""it is impossible to get rid of one's origins, it is impossible not to remain a Jew. The Jews, Ravelstein...thought, following the line laid down by [his] teacher Davarr [Strauss], were historically witnesses to the absence of redemption.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn194"" id=""ffn194"">[194]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ravelstein recounts a conversation with the Wolfowitz character, Philip Gorman, which reflects Wolfowitz's well-known desire to invade Iraq in 1991:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colin Powell and Baker have advised the President not to send the troops all the way to Baghdad. Bush will announce it tomorrow. They're afraid of a few casualties. They send out a terrific army and give a demonstration of up-to-date high-tech warfare that flesh and blood can't stand up to. But then they leave the dictatorship in place and steal away….<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn195"" id=""ffn195"">[195]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wolfowitz has had a close relationship with Richard Perle beginning with their service in the office of Sen. Henry Jackson.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn196"" id=""ffn196"">[196]</a></sup> He also has a long record of pro-Israel advocacy. In 1973 he was appointed to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA); Mark Green notes that ""Wolfowitz...brought to ACDA a strong attachment to Israel's security, and a certain confusion about his obligation to U.S. national security.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn197"" id=""ffn197"">[197]</a></sup> In 1978, he was investigated for providing a classified document to the Israeli government through an AIPAC intermediary, but the investigation ended without indictment. (As Paul Findley shows, leakage of classified information to Israel by American Jews is routine within the Departments of State and Defense—so routine that it is accepted as a part of life in these departments, and investigations of the source of leaks are seldom performed.)<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn198"" id=""ffn198"">[198]</a></sup> Later, in 1992, the Department of Defense discovered that Wolfowitz, as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, was promoting the export to Israel of advanced AIM-9M air-to-air missiles. The sale was canceled because Israel had been caught selling the previous version to the Chinese. Until his appointment as Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Bush administration, Wolfowitz was on the Advisory Board of WINEP, and was a patron of Dennis Ross, who was Ambassador to Israel in the Clinton Administration before becoming director of Policy and Strategic Planning at WINEP.</p>
<p>Wolfowitz wrote a 1997 <em>Weekly Standard</em> article advocating removal of Saddam Hussein, and signed the public letter to President Clinton organized by Bill Kristol's Project for the New American Century urging a regime change in Iraq. Within the George H. W. Bush administration, Wolfowitz was ""the intellectual godfather and fiercest advocate for toppling Saddam.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn199"" id=""ffn199"">[199]</a></sup> Wolfowitz has become famous as a key advocate for war with Iraq rather than Afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of September 11.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn200"" id=""ffn200"">[200]</a></sup> Richard Clarke recounts an incident on September 12, 2001, in which President Bush asked a group at the White House for any information that Saddam Hussein was involved in the September 11 attacks. After Bush left, a staffer ""stared at [Bush] with her mouth open. ‘Wolfowitz got to him.’”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn201"" id=""ffn201"">[201]</a></sup></p>
<p>Former CIA political analysts Kathleen and Bill Christison note that ""One source inside the administration has described [Wolfowitz] frankly as ‘over-the-top crazy when it comes to Israel.’”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn202"" id=""ffn202"">[202]</a></sup> Although they find such an assessment insufficiently nuanced, they acknowledge that zealotry for Israel is a prime motivator for Wolfowitz. Journalist Bill Keller is much more cautious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You hear from some of Wolfowitz's critics, always off the record, that Israel exercises a powerful gravitational pull on the man. They may not know that as a teenager he spent his father's sabbatical semester in Israel or that his sister is married to an Israeli, but they certainly know that he is friendly with Israel's generals and diplomats and that he is something of a hero to the heavily Jewish neoconservative movement. Those who know him well say this—leaving aside the offensive suggestion of dual loyalty—is looking at Wolfowitz through the wrong end of the telescope. As the Sadat story illustrates, he has generally been less excited by the security of Israel than by the promise of a more moderate Islam.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn203"" id=""ffn203"">[203]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a remarkable statement. ""The Sadat story"" refers to Wolfowitz's very positive reaction to Egypt's President Anwar Sadat's speech to the Knesset as part of the peace process between Israel and Egypt. Obviously, it is silly to suppose that this event shows Wolfowitz's relative disinterest in Israel's security. Moreover, statements linking Wolfowitz to Israel are always off the record, presumably because people fear retaliation for stating the obvious. Thus Bill Keller coyly manages to document the associations between Wolfowitz and Israel while finding assertions of dual loyalty ""offensive"" rather than a well-grounded probability.</p>
<p>One of Joshua Muravchik's apologetic claims is that ""in fact the careers of leading neoconservatives have rarely involved work on Middle East issues.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn204"" id=""ffn204"">[204]</a></sup> This is false. For example, Wolfowitz wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. During the Carter administration, he prepared the Limited Contingency Study, which emphasized the ""Iraqi threat"" to the region, and during the Reagan administration he lobbied against selling AWACS to Saudi Arabia and against negotiating with the Palestinians; during the George H. W. Bush administration he was Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, a position where he ""would once again have responsibility for arms control, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, the areas to which he had devoted the early years of his career.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn205"" id=""ffn205"">[205]</a></sup> </p>
<h3>Richard Perle</h3>
<p>Like Wolfowitz and the Strauss-Bloom nexus at the University of Chicago, for Perle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the defining moment in our history was certainly the Holocaust.... It was the destruction, the genocide of a whole people, and it was the failure to respond in a timely fashion to a threat that was clearly gathering....</p>
<p>We don't want that to happen again... when we have the ability to stop totalitarian regimes we should do so, because when we fail to do so, the results are catastrophic.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn206"" id=""ffn206"">[206]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Perle first came into prominence in Washington as Senator Henry Jackson's chief aide on foreign policy. He organized Congressional support for the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which angered Russia by linking bilateral trade issues to freedom of emigration, primarily of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel and the United States. In 1970 Perle was recorded by the FBI discussing classified information with the Israeli embassy. In 1981 he was on the payroll of an Israeli defense contractor shortly before being appointed Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, a position responsible for monitoring U.S. defense technology exports.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn207"" id=""ffn207"">[207]</a></sup> During his tenure in the Reagan administration Perle recommended purchase of an artillery shell made by Soltan, an Israeli munitions manufacturer. After leaving his position in the Defense Department in 1987, he assumed a position with Soltan. Like many other former government officials, he has also used his reputation and contacts in the government to develop a highly lucrative business career. For example, although he did not personally register as a lobbyist, he became a paid consultant to a firm headed by Douglas Feith that was established to lobby on behalf of Turkey.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn208"" id=""ffn208"">[208]</a></sup> At the present time, Perle is on the board of directors of Onset Technology, a technology company founded by Israelis Gadi Mazor and Ron Maor with R&amp;D in Israel. Onset Technology has close ties to Israeli companies and investment funds.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn209"" id=""ffn209"">[209]</a></sup> He is a close personal friend of Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn210"" id=""ffn210"">[210]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Perle was the ""Study Group Leader"" of a 1996 report titled <em>A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm</em> published by the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies (IASPS), an Israeli think tank. The membership of the study group illustrates the overlap between Israeli think tanks close to the Israeli government, American policy makers and government officials, and pro-Israel activists working in the United States. Other members of this group who accepted positions in the George W. Bush administration or in pro-Israel activist organizations in the United States include Douglas Feith (Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy), David Wurmser (member of IASPS, a protégé of Perle at the AEI, and senior advisor in the State Department), Meyrav Wurmser (head of the Hudson Institute [a neocon think tank]), James Colbert of JINSA, and Jonathan Torop (WINEP).</p>
<p>Despite Joshua Muravchik's apologetic claims,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn211"" id=""ffn211"">[211]</a></sup> the <em>Clean Break</em> report was clearly intended as advice for another of Perle's personal friends,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn212"" id=""ffn212"">[212]</a></sup> Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then the new prime minister of Israel; there is no indication that it was an effort to further U.S. interests in the region. The purpose was to ""forge a peace process and strategy based on an entirely <em>new intellectual foundation</em>, one that restores strategic initiative and provides the nation the room to engage every possible energy on rebuilding Zionism.” Indeed, the report advises the United States to avoid pressure on the Israelis to give land for peace, a strategy ""which required funneling American money to repressive and aggressive regimes, was risky, expensive, and very costly for both the U.S. and Israel, and placed the United States in roles it should neither have nor want.” The authors of the report speak as Jews and Israelis, not as U.S. citizens: ""Our claim to the land—to which we have clung for hope for 2000 years—is legitimate and noble.” Much of the focus is on removing the threat of Syria, and it is in this context that the report notes, ""This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq—an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right—as a means of foiling Syria's regional ambitions.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn213"" id=""ffn213"">[213]</a></sup></p>
<p>Proposals for regime change, such as found in <em>A Clean Break</em>, have a long history in Israeli thought. For example, in 1982 Israeli strategist Oded Yinon echoed a long line of Israeli strategists who argued that Israel should attempt to dissolve all the existing Arab states into smaller, less potentially powerful states. These states would then become clients of Israel as a regional imperial power. Neocons have advertised the war in Iraq as a crusade for a democratic, secular, Western-oriented, pro-Israel Iraq—a dream that has a great deal of appeal in the West, for obvious reasons. However, it is quite possible that the long-term result is that Iraq would fracture along ethnic and religious lines (Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds). This would also be in Israel's interests, because the resulting states would pose less of a threat than the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. As Yinon noted, ""Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, <em>is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel's targets</em>. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria. Iraq is stronger than Syria. In the short run it is Iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to Israel.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn214"" id=""ffn214"">[214]</a></sup></p>
<p>Former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson has suggested that the dissolution of Iraq may well have been a motive for the war:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A more cynical reading of the agenda of certain Bush advisers could conclude that the Balkanization of Iraq was always an acceptable outcome, because Israel would then find itself surrounded by small Arab countries worried about each other instead of forming a solid block against Israel. After all, Iraq was an artificial country that had always had a troublesome history.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn215"" id=""ffn215"">[215]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as the Iraqi insurgency has achieved momentum, there is evidence that Israeli military and intelligence units are operating in Kurdish regions of Iraq and that Israel is indeed encouraging the Kurds to form their own state.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn216"" id=""ffn216"">[216]</a></sup> There is little doubt that an independent Kurdish state would have major repercussions for Syria and Iran, as well as for Israel's ally Turkey, and would lead to continuing instability in the Middle East. A senior Turkish official noted, ""If you end up with a divided Iraq, it will bring more blood, tears, and pain to the Middle East, and [the U.S.] will be blamed.... From Mexico to Russia, everybody will claim that the United States had a secret agenda in Iraq: you came there to break up Iraq. If Iraq is divided, America cannot explain this to the world.”</p>
<h3>Elliott Abrams</h3>
<p>Some of Elliott Abrams's neoconservative family and professional associations have been described above. In December 2002 Abrams became President Bush's top Middle East advisor. He is closely associated with the Likud Party in Israel and with prominent neocons (Richard Perle, Bill Kristol, Reuel Marc Gerecht, Michael Ledeen, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Paul Wolfowitz) and neocon think tanks (PNAC, AEI, CSP, JINSA).<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn217"" id=""ffn217"">[217]</a></sup> Because of his reputation as a strongly identified Jew, Abrams was tapped for the role of rallying Jews in support of Reagan in the 1980 campaign.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn218"" id=""ffn218"">[218]</a></sup></p>
<p>Abrams is also an activist on behalf of Jewish continuity. The purpose of his book <em>Faith and Fear: How Jews Can Survive in Christian America</em> is to shore up Jewish religious identification, avoid intermarriage, and avoid secularization in order to assure Jewish continuity. In this regard it is interesting that other prominent neocons have advocated interracial marriage between whites and blacks in the United States. For example, Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the AEI, has written that the offspring of interracial marriages ""are the best hope for the future of American race relations.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn219"" id=""ffn219"">[219]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In <em>Faith and Fear</em>, Abrams notes his own deep immersion in the Yiddish-speaking culture of his parents and grandparents. In the grandparents' generation, ""all their children married Jews, and [they] kept Kosher homes.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn220"" id=""ffn220"">[220]</a></sup> Abrams acknowledges that the mainstream Jewish community ""clings to what is at bottom a dark vision of America, as a land permeated with anti-Semitism and always on the verge of anti-Semitic out-bursts.” The result is that Jews have taken the lead in secularizing America, but that has not been a good strategy for Jews because Jews themselves have become less religious and therefore less inclined to marry other Jews. (This ""dark vision of America” is a critical source of the ""Culture of Critique” produced by Jewish intellectual movements; it is also a major reason why the Jewish community has been united in favor of large–scale nonwhite immigration to America: Diluting the white majority and lessening their power is seen as preventing an anti-Jewish outburst.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn221"" id=""ffn221"">[221]</a></sup>) Following Strauss, therefore, Abrams thinks that a strong role for Christianity in America is good for Jews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this century we have seen two gigantic experiments at postreligious societies where the traditional restraints of religion and morality were entirely removed: Communism and Nazism. In both cases Jews became the special targets, but there was evil enough even without the scourge of anti-Semitism. For when the transcendental inhibition against evil is removed, when society becomes so purely secular that the restraints imposed by God on man are truly eradicated, minorities are but the earliest victims.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn222"" id=""ffn222"">[222]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Douglas Feith</h3>
<p>Like most of his cronies, Feith has been suspected of spying for Israel. In 1972 Feith was fired from a position with the National Security Council because of an investigation into whether he had provided documents to the Israeli embassy. Nevertheless, Perle, who was Assistant Secretary for International Security Policy, hired him as his ""special counsel,"" and then as his deputy. Feith worked for Perle until 1986, when he left government service to form a law firm, Feith and Zell, which was originally based in Israel and best known for obtaining a pardon for the notorious Marc Rich during the final days of the Clinton administration. In 2001, Douglas Feith returned to the Department of Defense as Donald Rumsfeld's Undersecretary for Policy, and it was in his office that Abram Shulsky's Office of Special Plans (OSP) was created. It was OSP that originated much of the fraudulent intelligence that Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld have used to justify the attack on Iraq. A key member of OSP was David Wurmser who, as indicated above, is a protégé of Richard Perle.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn223"" id=""ffn223"">[223]</a></sup></p>
<p>Retired army officer Karen Kwiatkowski describes Feith as knowing little about the Pentagon and paying little attention to any issues except those relating to Israel and Iraq.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn224"" id=""ffn224"">[224]</a></sup> Feith is deferential to the Israeli military. As Kwiatkowski escorted a group of Israeli generals into the Pentagon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he leader of the pack surged ahead, his colleagues in close formation, leaving us to double-time behind the group as they sped to Undersecretary Feith's office on the fourth floor.... Once in Feith's waiting room, the leader continued at speed to Feith's closed door. An alert secretary saw this coming and had leapt from her desk to block the door. ""Mr. Feith has a visitor. It will only be a few more minutes."" The leader craned his neck to look around the secretary's head as he demanded, ""Who is in there with him?""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the usual practice, the Israeli generals did not have to sign in, so there are no official records of their visits.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn225"" id=""ffn225"">[225]</a></sup> Kwiatkowski describes the anti-Arab, pro-Israel sentiment that pervaded the neocon network at the Department of Defense. Career military officers who failed to go along with these attitudes were simply replaced.</p>
<p>Feith has a strong Jewish identity and is an activist on behalf of Israel. While in law school he collaborated with Joseph Churba, an associate and friend of Meir Kahane, founder of the racialist and anti-Western Jewish Defense League. During the late 1980s to early 1990s he wrote pro-Likud op-ed pieces in Israeli newspapers, arguing that the West Bank is part of Israel, that the Palestinians belong in Jordan, and that there should be regime change in Iraq. He also headed the CSP and was a founding member of One Jerusalem, an Israeli organization ""determined to prevent any compromise with the Palestinians over the fate of any part of Jerusalem.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn226"" id=""ffn226"">[226]</a></sup></p>
<p>He is an officer of the Foundation for Jewish Studies, which is ""dedicated to fostering Jewish learning and building communities of educated and committed Jews who are conscious of, and faithful to, the high ideals of Judaism.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn227"" id=""ffn227"">[227]</a></sup> In 1997 Feith and his father (a member of Betar, the Zionist youth movement founded by Vladimir Jabotinsky) were given awards from the ZOA because of their work as pro-Israel activists. The ZOA is a staunch supporter of the most extreme elements within Israel. Feith's law partner, L. Marc Zell of the firm's Tel Aviv office, is a spokesman for the settler movement in Israel, and the firm itself is deeply involved in legal issues related to the reconstruction of Iraq, a situation that has raised eyebrows because Feith is head of reconstruction in Iraq.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn228"" id=""ffn228"">[228]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Zell was one of many neocons close to Ahmed Chalabi but abandoned his support because Chalabi had not come through on his prewar pledges regarding Israel—further evidence that aiding Israel was an important motive for the neocons. According to Zell, Chalabi ""said he would end Iraq's boycott of trade with Israel, and would allow Israeli companies to do business there. He said [the new Iraqi government] would agree to rebuild the pipeline from Mosul [in the northern Iraqi oil fields] to Haifa [the Israeli port, and the location of a major refinery].”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn229"" id=""ffn229"">[229]</a></sup> Another partner in the law firm of Feith and Zell is Salem Chalabi, Ahmed Chalabi's nephew. Salem Chalabi is in charge of the trial of Saddam Hussein.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn230"" id=""ffn230"">[230]</a></sup> </p>
<h3>Abram Shulsky</h3>
<p>Abram Shulsky is a student of Leo Strauss, a close friend of Paul Wolfowitz both at Cornell and the University of Chicago,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn231"" id=""ffn231"">[231]</a></sup> and yet another protégé of Richard Perle. He was an aide to neocon Senators Henry Jackson (along with Perle and Elliot Abrams) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and worked in the Department of Defense in the Reagan administration. During the George W. Bush administration, he was appointed head of the Office of Special Plans under Feith and Wolfowitz. The OSP became more influential on Iraq policy than the CIA or the Defense Intelligence Agency,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn232"" id=""ffn232"">[232]</a></sup> but is widely viewed by retired intelligence operatives as manipulating intelligence data on Iraq in order to influence policy.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn233"" id=""ffn233"">[233]</a></sup> Reports suggest that the OSP worked closely with Israeli intelligence to paint an exaggerated picture of Iraqi capabilities in unconventional weapons.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn234"" id=""ffn234"">[234]</a></sup> It is tempting to link the actions of the OSP under Shulsky with Strauss's idea of a ""noble lie"" carried out by the elite to manipulate the masses, but I suppose that one doesn't really need Strauss to understand the importance of lying in order to manipulate public opinion on behalf of Israel.</p>
<p>The OSP included other neocons with no professional qualifications in intelligence but long records of service in neoconservative think tanks and pro-Israel activist organizations, especially the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Examples include Michael Rubin, who is affiliated with AEI and is an adjunct scholar at WINEP, David Schenker, who has written books and articles on Middle East issues published by WINEP and the <em>Middle East Quarterly</em> (published by Daniel Pipes's MEF, another pro-Israel activist organization), Elliott Abrams, David Wurmser, and Michael Ledeen. The OSP relied heavily on Iraqi defectors associated with Ahmed Chalabi, who, as indicated above, had a close personal relationship with Wolfowitz, Perle, and other neocons.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn235"" id=""ffn235"">[235]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Michael Ledeen</h3>
<p>Michael Ledeen's career illustrates the interconnectedness of the neoconservative network. Ledeen was the first executive director of JINSA (1977-1979) and remains on its board of advisors. He was hired by Richard Perle in the Defense Department during the Reagan years, and during the same period he was hired as special advisor by Wolfowitz in his role as head of the State Department Policy Planning Staff. Along with Stephen Bryen, Ledeen became a member of the China Commission during the George W. Bush administration. He was also a consultant to Abram Shulsky's OSP, the Defense Department organization most closely linked with the manufacture of fraudulent intelligence leading up to the Iraq War. The OSP was created by Douglas Feith, who in turn reports to Paul Wolfowitz. As noted above, he is resident scholar in the Freedom Chair at AEI.</p>
<p>Ledeen has been suspected of spying for Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn236"" id=""ffn236"">[236]</a></sup> During the Reagan years, he was regarded by the CIA as ""an agent of influence of a foreign government: Israel,"" and was suspected of spying for Israel by his immediate superior at the Department of Defense, Noel Koch.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn237"" id=""ffn237"">[237]</a></sup> While working for the White House in 1984, Ledeen was also accused by National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane of participating in an unauthorized meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres that led to the proposal to funnel arms through Israel to Iran in order to free U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon—the origins of the Irangate scandal.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn238"" id=""ffn238"">[238]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ledeen has been a major propagandist for forcing change on the entire Arab world. Ledeen's revolutionary ideology stems not from Trotsky or Marx, but from his favorable view of Italian fascism as a universalist (nonracial) revolutionary movement.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn239"" id=""ffn239"">[239]</a></sup> His book, <em>War on the Terror Masters</em>, is a program for complete restructuring of the Middle East by the United States couched in the rhetoric of universalism and moral concern, not for Israel, but for the Arab peoples who would benefit from regime change. Ledeen is a revolutionary of the right, committed to ""creative destruction"" of the old social order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creative destruction is our middle name, both within our own society and abroad. We tear down the old order every day, from business to science, literature, art, architecture, and cinema to politics and the law. Our enemies have always hated this whirlwind of energy and creativity, which menaces their traditions (whatever they may be) and shames them for their inability to keep pace. Seeing America undo traditional societies, they fear us, for they do not wish to be undone. They cannot feel secure so long as we are there, for our very existence—our existence, not our politics—threatens their legitimacy. They must attack us in order to survive, just as we must destroy them to advance our historic mission... . </p>
<p>Behind all the anti-American venom from the secular radicals in Baghdad, the religious fanatics in Tehran, the minority regime in Damascus, and the multicultural kleptomaniacs in the Palestinian Authority is the knowledge that they are hated by their own people. Their power rests on terror, recently directed against us, but always, first and foremost, against their own citizens. Given the chance to express themselves freely, the Iraqi, Iranian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian people would oust their current oppressors. Properly waged, our revolutionary war will give them a chance.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn240"" id=""ffn240"">[240]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Bernard Lewis</h3>
<p>The main intellectual source for imposing democracy on the Arab world is Bernard Lewis, the Princeton historian who argues that Muslim cultures have an inferiority complex stemming from their relative decline compared to the West over the last three hundred years. (Such arguments minimize the role of Israel and U.S. support for Israel as a sourse of Arab malaise. However, there is good evidence that the motives of Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 conspirators derive much more from U.S. support for Israel than a general anti-Western animus.)<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn241"" id=""ffn241"">[241]</a></sup> He contends that Arab societies with their antiquated, kinship-based structure can only be changed by forcing democracy on them.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn242"" id=""ffn242"">[242]</a></sup> Wolfowitz has used Lewis as the intellectual underpinning of the invasion of Iraq: ""Bernard has taught how to understand the complex and important history of the Middle East, and use it to guide us where we will go next to build a better world for generations to come.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn243"" id=""ffn243"">[243]</a></sup> During the 1970s Lewis was invited by Richard Perle to give a talk to Henry Jackson's group, and, as Perle notes, ""Lewis became Jackson's guru, more or less.” Lewis also established ties with Daniel Patrick Moynihan and with Jackson's other aides, including Wolfowitz, Abrams, and Gaffney. One of Lewis's main arguments is that the Palestinians have no historical claim to a state because they were not a state before the British Mandate in 1918.</p>
<p>Lewis also argues that Arabs have a long history of consensus government, if not democracy, and that a modicum of outside force should be sufficient to democratize the area—a view that runs counter to the huge cultural differences between the Middle East and the West that stem ultimately from very different evolutionary pressures.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn244"" id=""ffn244"">[244]</a></sup> Lewis, as a cultural historian, is in a poor position to understand the deep structure of the cultural differences between Europe and the Middle East. He seems completely unaware of the differences in family and kinship structure between Europe and the Middle East, and he regards the difference in attitudes toward women as a mere cultural difference rather than as a marker for an entirely different social structure.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn245"" id=""ffn245"">[245]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Lewis's flawed beliefs about the Middle East have nevertheless been quite useful to Israel—reflecting the theme that Jewish intellectual movements have often used available intellectual resources to advance a political cause. Not only did he provide an important intellectual rationale for the war against Iraq, he is very close to governmental and academic circles in Israel—the confidant of successive Israeli prime ministers from Golda Meir to Ariel Sharon.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn246"" id=""ffn246"">[246]</a></sup> </p>
<h3>Dick Cheney</h3>
<p>By several accounts, Vice President Cheney had a ""fever"" to invade Iraq and transform the politics of the Middle East and was the leading force within the administration convincing President Bush of the need to do so.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn247"" id=""ffn247"">[247]</a></sup> As with the other Jewish intellectual and political movements I have reviewed, non-Jews have been welcomed into the movement and often given highly visible roles as the movement's public face. Among the current crop in this intellectual lineage, the most important non-Jews are Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, both of whom have close professional and personal relationships with neoconservatives that long predate their present power and visibility. Both Cheney and Rumsfeld have been associated with Bill Kristol's PNAC (which advocated a unilateral war for regime change in Iraq at least as early as 1998)<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn248"" id=""ffn248"">[248]</a></sup> and the CSP, two neocon think tanks; Cheney was presented with the ADL's Distinguished Statesman Award in 1993 and was described by Abraham Foxman as ""sensitive to Jewish concerns.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn249"" id=""ffn249"">[249]</a></sup> When Cheney was a Congressman during the early 1980s, he attended lunches hosted for Republican Jewish leaders by the House leadership. Cheney was described by Marshall Breger, a senior official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administration, as ""very interested in outreach and engaging the Jewish community.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn250"" id=""ffn250"">[250]</a></sup> He was also a member of JINSA, a major pro-Israel activist organization, until assuming his office as vice president.</p>
<p>Cheney has also had a close involvement with leading Israeli politicians, especially Natan Sharansky, Secretary of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs in the Likud government and the prime architect of the ideology that the key to peace between Israel and the Arab world, including the Palestinians, is Arab acceptance of democracy. When President Bush articulated the importance of Palestinian democracy for the Middle East peace ""roadmap"" in his June 2002 policy speech:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sharansky could have written the speech himself, and, for that matter, may have had a direct hand in its drafting. The weekend prior to the speech, he spent long hours at a conference [organized by Richard Perle and] sponsored by the AEI in Aspen secluded together with Vice President Cheney and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. The Bush speech clearly represented a triumph for the Cheney-Rumsfeld-Wolfowitz axis in the administration over the State Department, which was eager to offer the Palestinians a provisional state immediately.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn251"" id=""ffn251"">[251]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Cheney and Rumsfeld have close personal relationships with Kenneth Adelman, a former Ford and Reagan administration official.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn252"" id=""ffn252"">[252]</a></sup> Adelman wrote op-ed pieces in the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in the period leading up to the war, and he, along with Wolfowitz and Irving Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby (Cheney's chief of staff), were guests of Cheney for a victory celebration in the immediate aftermath of the war (April 13, 2003).<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn253"" id=""ffn253"">[253]</a></sup> Adelman has excellent neocon credentials. He was a member of the Committee on the Present Danger in the 1970s, and UN Ambassador during the Reagan Administration, and worked under Donald Rumsfeld on three different occasions. He was a signatory to the April 3, 2002, letter of the Project for a New American Century to President Bush calling for Saddam Hussein's ouster and increased support for Israel. The letter stated, ""Israel is targeted in part because it is our friend, and in part because it is an island of liberal, democratic principles—American principles—in a sea of tyranny, intolerance, and hatred.” The advocacy of war with Iraq was linked to advancing Israeli interests: ""If we do not move against Saddam Hussein and his regime, the damage our Israeli friends and we have suffered until now may someday appear but a prelude to much greater horrors... Israel's fight against terrorism is our fight. Israel's victory is an important part of our victory. For reasons both moral and strategic, we need to stand with Israel in its fight against terrorism.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn254"" id=""ffn254"">[254]</a></sup> Adelman's wife, Carol, is affiliated with the Hudson Institute, a neoconservative think tank.</p>
<p>Cheney's role in the ascendancy of the neocons in the Bush administration is particularly important: As head of the transition team, he and Libby were able to staff the subcabinet levels of the State Department (John Bolton) and the Defense Department (Wolfowitz, Feith) with key supporters of the neocon agenda. Libby is a close personal friend of Cheney whose views ""echo many of Wolfowitz's policies”; he ""is considered a hawk among hawks and was an early supporter of military action against terrorism and particularly against Iraq.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn255"" id=""ffn255"">[255]</a></sup> He is Jewish and has a long history of involvement in Zionist causes and as the attorney for the notorious Marc Rich. Libby and Cheney were involved in pressuring the CIA to color intelligence reports to fit with their desire for a war with Iraq.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn256"" id=""ffn256"">[256]</a></sup> Libby entered the neocon orbit when he was ""captivated” while taking a political science course from Wolfowitz at Yale, and he worked under Wolfowitz in the Reagan and the Bush I administrations.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn257"" id=""ffn257"">[257]</a></sup> He was the coauthor (with Wolfowitz) of the ill-fated draft of the Defense Planning Guidance document of 1992, which advocated U.S. dominance over all of Eurasia and urged preventing any other country from even contemplating challenging U.S. hegemony.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn258"" id=""ffn258"">[258]</a></sup> (Cheney was Secretary of Defense at that time.) After an uproar, the document was radically altered, but this blueprint for U.S. hegemony remains central to neocon attitudes since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Donald Rumsfeld</h3>
<p>As noted above, Rumsfeld has deep links with neoconservative think tanks and individual Jews such as Ken Adelman, who began his career working for Rumsfeld when he headed the Office of Economic Opportunity in the Nixon administration. Another close associate is Robert A. Goldwin, a student of Leo Strauss and Rumsfeld's deputy both at NATO and at the Gerald Ford White House; Goldwin is now resident scholar at the AEI.</p>
<p>Rumsfeld also has a long history of appealing to Jewish and Israeli causes. In his 1964 campaign for reelection to Congress as representative from a district on the North Shore of Chicago with an important Jewish constituency, he emphasized Soviet persecution of Jews and introduced a bill on this topic in the House. After the 1967 war, he urged the U.S. not to demand that Israel withdraw to its previous borders and he criticized delays in sending U.S. military hardware to Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn259"" id=""ffn259"">[259]</a></sup> More recently, as Secretary of Defense in the Bush II administration, Rumsfeld was praised by the ZOA for distancing himself from the phrase ""occupied territories,"" referring to them as the ""so-called occupied territories.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn260"" id=""ffn260"">[260]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Despite these links with neoconservatives and Jewish causes, Rumsfeld emerges as less an ideologue and less a passionate advocate for war with Iraq than Cheney. Robert Woodward describes him as lacking the feverish intensity of Cheney, as a dispassionate ""defense technocrat"" who, unlike Cheney, Wolfowitz, and Feith, would have been content if the United States had not gone to war with Iraq.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn261"" id=""ffn261"">[261]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Daniel Pipes</h3>
<p>Many neoconservatives work mainly as lobbyists and propagandists. Rather than attempt to describe this massive infrastructure in its entirety, I profile Daniel Pipes as a prototypical example of the highly competent Jewish lobbyist. Pipes is the son of Richard Pipes, the Harvard professor who, as noted above, was an early neocon and an expert on the Soviet Union. He is the director of the MEF, and a columnist at the <em>New York Post</em> and the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>, and appears on the Fox News Channel. Pipes is described as ""An authoritative commentator on the Middle East"" by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, according to the bio page of his website.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn262"" id=""ffn262"">[262]</a></sup> A former official in the Departments of State and Defense, he has taught at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and the U.S. Naval War College. He is the author of twelve books on the Middle East, Islam, and other political topics; his most recent book is <em>Militant Islam Reaches America</em> (published by W.W. Norton, 2002), a polemic against political Islam which argues that militant Islam is the greatest threat to the West since the Cold War. He serves on the ""Special Task Force on Terrorism and Technology"" at the Department of Defense, has testified before many congressional committees, and served on four presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>Martin Kramer is the editor of the Forum's journal. Kramer is also affiliated with Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies. His book <em>Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America</em> has been a major impetus behind the recent effort to prevent criticism of Israel on college campuses. The book was warmly reviewed in the <em>Weekly Standard</em>, whose editor, Bill Kristol, is a member of the MEF along with Kramer. Kristol wrote that ""Kramer has performed a crucial service by exposing intellectual rot in a scholarly field of capital importance to national wellbeing.""</p>
<p>The MEF issues two regular quasi-academic publications, the <em>Middle East Quarterly</em> and the <em>Middle East Intelligence Bulletin</em>, the latter published jointly with the United States Committee for a Free Lebanon. The <em>Middle East Quarterly</em> describes itself as ""a bold, insightful, and controversial publication."" A recent article on weapons of mass destruction claims that Syria ""has more destructive capabilities"" than Iraq or Iran. The <em>Middle East Intelligence Bulletin</em> ""specializes in covering the seamy side of Lebanese and Syrian politics,”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn263"" id=""ffn263"">[263]</a></sup> an effort aimed at depicting these regimes as worthy of forcible change by the United States or Israeli military. The MEF also targets universities through its campus speakers bureau, seeking to correct ""inaccurate Middle Eastern curricula in American education"" by addressing ""biases"" and ""basic errors"" and providing ""better information"" than students can get from the many ""irresponsible"" professors that it believes lurk in U.S. universities.</p>
<p>The MEF is behind Campus Watch, an organization responsible for repressing academic discussion of Middle East issues at U.S. universities. Campus Watch compiles profiles on professors who criticize Israel: A major purpose is to ""identify key faculty who teach and write about contemporary affairs at university Middle East Studies departments in order to analyze and critique the work of these specialists for errors or biases."" The MEF also develops ""a network of concerned students and faculty members interested in promoting American interests on campus.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn264"" id=""ffn264"">[264]</a></sup></p>
<p>Again we see the rhetoric of universalism and a concern with ""American interests"" produced by people who are ethnically Jewish and vitally concerned with the welfare of Israel. Recently Campus Watch has decided to discontinue its dossiers because over one hundred professors asked to be included in their directory of suspicious people. Nevertheless, Campus Watch continues to print names of people whose views on the Middle East differ from theirs. The MEF, along with major Jewish activist organizations (the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress, and the Anti-Defamation League), has succeeded in getting the U.S. House of Representatives to overwhelmingly approve a bill that would authorize federal monitoring of government-funded Middle East studies programs throughout U.S. universities. The bill would establish a federal tribunal to investigate and monitor criticism of Israel on American college campuses.</p>
<h3>Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA)</h3>
<p>Rather than profile all of the many neoconservative think tanks and lobbying groups, I will describe JINSA as a prototypical example. JINSA attempts to ""educate the American public about the importance of an effective U.S. defense capability so that our vital interests as Americans can be safeguarded [and to] inform the American defense and foreign affairs community about the important role Israel can and does play in bolstering democratic interests in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn265"" id=""ffn265"">[265]</a></sup> Typical of Jewish intellectual movements is that Jewish interests are submerged in a rhetoric of American interests and ethical universalism—in this case, the idea that Israel is a beacon of democracy.</p>
<p>In addition to a core of prominent neoconservative Jews (Stephen D. Bryen, Douglas Feith, Max Kampelman, Michael Ledeen, Joshua Muravchik, Richard Perle, Stephen Solarz), JINSA's advisory board includes a bevy of non-Jewish retired U.S. military officers and a variety of non-Jewish political figures (e.g., Dick Cheney) and foreign policy analysts with access to the media (e.g., Jeane Kirkpatrick) who are staunch supporters of Israel. As is typical of Jewish intellectual movements, JINSA is well funded and has succeeded in bringing in high-profile non-Jews who often act as spokesmen for its policies. For example, the former head of the Iraq occupation government, General Jay Garner, signed a JINSA letter stating that ""the Israel Defense Forces have exercised remarkable restraint in the face of lethal violence orchestrated by the leadership of [the] Palestinian Authority.""</p>
<p>JINSA reflects the recent trend of American Jewish activist groups not simply to support Israeli policies but to support the Israeli right wing. For JINSA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>’regime change' by any means necessary in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority is an urgent imperative. Anyone who dissents—be it Colin Powell's State Department, the CIA or career military officers—is committing heresy against articles of faith that effectively hold there is no difference between US and Israeli national security interests, and that the only way to assure continued safety and prosperity for both countries is through hegemony in the Middle East—a hegemony achieved with the traditional Cold War recipe of feints, force, clientism and covert action.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn266"" id=""ffn266"">[266]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the exclusionary, us versus them attitude typical of the Jewish intellectual and political movements covered in <em>The Culture of Critique</em>.</p>
<p>Part of JINSA's effectiveness comes from recruiting non-Jews who gain by increased defense spending or are willing to be spokesmen in return for fees and travel to Israel. The bulk of JINSA's budget is spent on taking a host of retired U.S. generals and admirals to Israel, where JINSA facilitates meetings between Israeli officials and retired but still-influential U.S. flag officers. These officers then write op-ed pieces and sign letters and advertisements championing the Likudnik line. In one such statement, issued soon after the outbreak of the latest intifada, twenty-six JINSAns of retired flag rank, including many from the advisory board, struck a moralizing tone, characterizing Palestinian violence as a ""perversion of military ethics"" and holding that ""America's role as facilitator in this process should never yield to America's responsibility as a friend to Israel,"" because ""friends don't leave friends on the battlefield.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn267"" id=""ffn267"">[267]</a></sup> Sowing seeds for the future, JINSA also takes U.S. service academy cadets to Israel each summer and sponsors a lecture series at the Army, Navy, and Air Force academies.</p>
<p>JINSA also patronizes companies in the defense industry that stand to gain by the drive for total war. ""Almost every retired officer who sits on JINSA's board of advisers or has participated in its Israel trips or signed a JINSA letter works or has worked with military contractors who do business with the Pentagon and Israel.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn268"" id=""ffn268"">[268]</a></sup> For example, JINSA advisory board members Adm. Leon Edney, Adm. David Jeremiah, and Lieut. Gen. Charles May, all retired, have served Northrop Grumman or its subsidiaries as either consultants or board members. Northrop Grumman has built ships for the Israeli Navy and sold F-16 avionics and E-2C Hawkeye planes to the Israeli Air Force, as well as the Longbow radar system to the Israeli Army for use in its attack helicopters. It also works with Tamam, a subsidiary of Israeli Aircraft Industries, to produce an unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>
<p>JINSA is supported not only by defense contractor money but also by deeply committed Zionists, notably Irving Moskowitz, the California bingo magnate who also provides financial support to the AEI. Moskowitz not only sends millions of dollars a year to far-right Israeli West Bank settler groups like Ateret Cohanim, he has also funded land purchases in key Arab areas around Jerusalem. Moskowitz provided the money that enabled the 1996 reopening of a tunnel under the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, which resulted in seventy deaths due to rioting. Also involved in funding JINSA is New York investment banker Lawrence Kadish, who also contributes to Republican causes. Again, we see the effects of the most committed Jews. People like Moskowitz have an enormous effect because they use their wealth to advance their people's interests, a very common pattern among wealthy Jews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn269"" id=""ffn269"">[269]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The integration of JINSA with the U.S. defense establishment can be seen in the program for its 2001 Jackson Award Dinner, an annual event named after Senator Henry Jackson that draws an ""A-list"" group of politicians and defense celebrities. At the dinner were representatives of U.S. defense industries (the dinner was sponsored by Boeing), as well as the following Defense Department personnel: Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz; Under Secretary of Defense Dov Zakheim (an ordained rabbi); Assistant Secretary of the Navy John Young; Dr. Bill Schneider, Jr., the Chairman of the Defense Science Board; the Honorable Mark Rosenker, Senior Military Advisor to the President; Admiral William Fallon, Vice Chief of Naval Operations; General John Keane, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army; General Michael Williams, Vice Commandant of the Marines; Lieutenant General Lance Lord, Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Also present were a large number of U.S. flag and general officers who were alumni of JINSA trips to Israel, as well as assorted Congressmen, a U.S. Senator, and a variety of Israeli military and political figures. The 2002 Jackson Award Dinner, sponsored by Northrup Grumman, honored Paul Wolfowitz. Dick Cheney was a previous recipient of the award.</p>
<p>JINSA is a good illustration of the point that whatever the deeply held beliefs of the non-Jews who are involved in the neoconservative movement, financial motives and military careerism are also of considerable importance—a testimony to the extent to which neoconservatism has permeated the political and military establishments of the United States. A similar statement could be made about the deep influence of neoconservatism among intellectuals generally.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The current situation in the United States is really an awesome display of Jewish power and influence. People who are very strongly identified as Jews maintain close ties to Israeli politicians and military figures and to Jewish activist organizations and pro-Israeli lobbying groups while occupying influential policy-making positions in the defense and foreign policy establishment. These same people, as well as a chorus of other prominent Jews, have routine access to the most prestigious media outlets in the United States. People who criticize Israel are routinely vilified and subjected to professional abuse.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn270"" id=""ffn270"">[270]</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps the most telling feature of this entire state of affairs is the surreal fact that in this entire discourse Jewish identity is not mentioned. When Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, Michael Rubin, William Safire, Robert Satloff, or the legions of other prominent media figures write their reflexively pro-Israel pieces in the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, or the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, or opine on the Fox News Network, there is never any mention that they are Jewish Americans who have an intense ethnic interest in Israel. When Richard Perle authors a report for an Israeli think tank; is on the board of directors of an Israeli newspaper; maintains close personal ties with prominent Israelis, especially those associated with the Likud Party; has worked for an Israeli defense company; and, according to credible reports, was discovered by the FBI passing classified information to Israel—when, despite all of this, he is a central figure in the network of those pushing for wars to rearrange the entire politics of the Middle East in Israel's favor, and with nary a soul having the courage to mention the obvious overriding Jewish loyalty apparent in Perle's actions, that is indeed a breathtaking display of power.</p>
<p>One must contemplate the fact that American Jews have managed to maintain unquestioned support for Israel over the last thirty-seven years, despite Israel's seizing land and engaging in a brutal suppression of the Palestinians in the occupied territories—an occupation that will most likely end with expulsion or complete subjugation, degradation, and apartheid. During the same period Jewish organizations in America have been a principal force—in my view the main force—for transforming America into a state dedicated to suppressing ethnic identification among Europeans, for encouraging massive multiethnic immigration into the United States, and for erecting a legal system and cultural ideology that is obsessively sensitive to the complaints and interests of non-European ethnic minorities—the culture of the Holocaust.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn271"" id=""ffn271"">[271]</a></sup> All this is done without a whisper of double standards in the aboveground media.</p>
<p>I have also provided a small glimpse of the incredible array of Jewish pro-Israel activist organizations, their funding, their access to the media, and their power over the political process. Taken as a whole, neoconservatism is an excellent illustration of the key traits behind the success of Jewish activism: ethnocentrism, intelligence and wealth, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn272"" id=""ffn272"">[272]</a></sup> Now imagine a similar level of organization, commitment, and funding directed toward changing the U.S. immigration system put into law in 1924 and 1952, or inaugurating the revolution in civil rights, or the post-1965 countercultural revolution: In the case of the immigration laws we see the same use of prominent non-Jews to attain Jewish goals, the same access to the major media, and the same ability to have a decisive influence on the political process by establishing lobbying organizations, recruiting non-Jews as important players, funneling financial and media support to political candidates who agree with their point of view, and providing effective leadership in government.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn273"" id=""ffn273"">[273]</a></sup> Given this state of affairs, one can easily see how Jews, despite being a tiny minority of the U.S. population, have been able to transform the country to serve their interests. It's a story that has been played out many times in Western history, but the possible effects now seem enormous, not only for Europeans but literally for everyone on the planet, as Israel and its hegemonic ally restructure the politics of the world.</p>
<p>History also suggests that anti-Jewish reactions develop as Jews increase their control over other peoples.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn274"" id=""ffn274"">[274]</a></sup> As always, it will be fascinating to observe the dénouement.</p>

<li id=""fn11""><p>B. Wattenberg interview with Richard Perle, PBS, November 14, 2002. http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1017.html. The entire relevant passage from the interview follows. Note Perle's odd argument that it was not in Israel's interest that the U.S. invade Iraq because Saddam Hussein posed a much greater threat to Israel than the U.S.</p>
<p>BEN WATTENBERG: As this argument has gotten rancorous, there is also an undertone that says that these neoconservative hawks, that so many of them are Jewish. Is that valid and how do you handle that?</p>
<p>RICHARD PERLE: Well, a number are. I see Trent Lott there and maybe that's Newt Gingrich, I'm not sure, but by no means uniformly.</p>
<p>BEN WATTENBERG: Well, and of course the people who are executing policy, President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Don Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Connie Rice, they are not Jewish at last report.</p>
<p>RICHARD PERLE: No, they're not. Well, you're going to find a disproportionate number of Jews in any sort of intellectual undertaking.</p>
<p>BEN WATTENBERG: On both sides.</p>
<p>RICHARD PERLE: On both sides. Jews gravitate toward that and I'll tell you if you balance out the hawkish Jews against the dovish ones, then we are badly outnumbered, badly outnumbered. But look, there's clearly an undertone of anti-Semitism about it. There's no doubt.</p>
<p>BEN WATTENBERG: Well, and the linkage is that this war on Iraq if it comes about would help Israel and that that's the hidden agenda, and that's sort of the way that works.</p>
<p>RICHARD PERLE: Well, sometimes there's an out and out accusation that if you take the view that I take and some others take towards Saddam Hussein, we are somehow motivated not by the best interest of the United States but by Israel's best interest. There's not a logical argument underpinning that. In fact, Israel is probably more exposed and vulnerable in the context of a war with Saddam than we are because they're right next door. Weapons that Saddam cannot today deliver against us could potentially be delivered against Israel. And for a long time the Israelis themselves were very reluctant to take on Saddam Hussein. I've argued this issue with Israelis. But it's a nasty line of argument to suggest that somehow we're confused about where our loyalties are.</p>
<p>BEN WATTENBERG: It's the old dual loyalty argument. <a href=""#ffn11"">↩</a></p>

<li id=""fn90""><p>Wisse singles out Arthur Hertzberg as an example of an American Jew critical of Begin's government. Hertzberg continues to be a critic of Israeli policies, especially of the settlement movement. In a <em>New York Times</em> op-ed piece, ""The price of not keeping the peace"" of August 27, 2003, http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/27/opinion/the-price-of-not-keeping-the-peace.html. Hertzberg urges the United States to cease funding the expansion of Jewish settlements while also preventing the Palestinians' access to foreign funds used for violence against Israel:</p>
<p>The United States must act now to disarm each side of the nasty things that they can do to each other. We must end the threat of the settlements to a Palestinian state of the future. The Palestinian militants must be forced to stop threatening the lives of Israelis, wherever they may be. A grand settlement is not in sight, but the United States can lead both parties to a more livable, untidy accommodation. <a href=""#ffn90"">↩</a></p>

Whereas the Likud policy has been to seize as much of the West Bank as possible and relegate the Palestinians to isolated, impotent Bantustan-like enclaves, Jackson favored full sovereignty for the Palestinians on the West Bank, except for national security and foreign policy. <a href=""#ffn118"">↩</a></li>

Another prominent neocon, Ben Wattenberg, who is a senior fellow at AEI, is very upbeat about interracial marriage and immigration generally-the better to create a ""universal nation"" (Wattenberg 2001). Wattenberg's article notes, with no apparent concern, that Jews have high rates of intermarriage as well. <a href=""#ffn219"">↩</a></li>

<p>Why did the neocons put such enormous faith in Ahmed Chalabi, an exile with a shady past and no standing with Iraqis? One word: Israel. They saw the invasion of Iraq as the precondition for a reorganization of the Middle East that would solve Israel's strategic problems, without the need for an accommodation with either the Palestinians or the existing Arab states. Chalabi assured them that the Iraqi democracy he would build would develop diplomatic and trade ties with Israel, and eschew Arab nationalism. Now some influential allies believe those assurances were part of an elaborate con, and that Chalabi has betrayed his promises on Israel while cozying up to Iranian Shia leaders. <a href=""#ffn229"">↩</a></p>

<p>Now [Sharansky] delivered the same message to Cheney: No matter how many conditions Bush placed on the creation of a Palestinian state under Arafat, any such announcement would constitute a reward for two years of non-stop terror against Israeli civilians. The normally laconic Cheney shot to attention when he heard these words. ""But your own government has already signed off on this,' he told Sharansky, confirming the latter's worst suspicions. Sharansky nevertheless repeated, as Cheney scribbled notes, that without the removal of Arafat and the entire junta from Tunis, the creation of an atmosphere in which Palestinians could express themselves without fear of reprisal, and the cessation of incitement against Israel in the Palestinian schools and media peace is impossible. President Bush's upcoming speech had already undergone 30 drafts at that point. It was about to undergo another crucial shift based on Sharansky's conversation with Cheney. Two days later, on June 24, 2002, President Bush announced at the outset, ""Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership.' He did not mention Yasir Arafat once. <a href=""#ffn251"">↩</a></p>

<div class=""author-bio""><p>Kevin MacDonald is a retired Professor of  Psychology at California State University–Long Beach. After receiving a Masters degree in evolutionary biology, he received a Ph. D. in Biobehavioral Sciences, both at the University of Connecticut.  Since assuming his position at California State University–Long Beach, his research has focused on developing evolutionary perspectives on culture, developmental psychology and personality theory, the origins and maintenance of monogamous marriage in Western Europe, and ethnic relations (group evolutionary strategies). He is the author of more than 100 scholarly papers and reviews, and he is the author of Social and Personality Development: An Evolutionary Synthesis (1988), A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (1994), Separation and Its Discontents: Toward an Evolutionary Theory of Anti-Semitism (1998), and The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements (1998). He has also edited three books, Sociobiological Perspectives on Human Development (1988), Parent-Child Play: Descriptions and Implications (1994), and Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Development (2004).

In fact, Zionism is incredibly important. As of this writing, the United States has recently accomplished the destruction of the Iraqi regime, and it is common among influential Jews to advocate war between the United States and the entire Muslim world. In a recent issue of <em>Commentary</em> (an influential journal published by the American Jewish Committee), editor Norman Podhoretz states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The regimes that richly deserve to be overthrown and replaced are not confined to the three singled-out members of the axis of evil [i.e., Iraq, Iran, and North Korea]. At a minimum, the axis should extend to Syria and Lebanon and Libya, as well as “friends” of America like the Saudi royal family and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, along with the Palestinian Authority, whether headed by Arafat or one of his henchmen.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">[2]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than anything else, this is a list of countries that Israel doesn't like, and, as I discuss in the third part of this series, intensely committed Zionists with close links to Israel occupy prominent positions in the Bush administration, especially in the Department of Defense and on the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney. The long-term consequence of Zionism is that the U.S. is on the verge of attempting to completely transform the Arab/Muslim world to produce governments that accept Israel and whatever fate it decides for the Palestinians, and, quite possibly, to set the stage for further Israeli expansionism.</p>
<p>Zionism is an example of an important principle in Jewish history: At all the turning points, it is the more ethnocentric elements—one might term them the radicals—who have determined the direction of the Jewish community and eventually won the day.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">[3]</a></sup> As recounted in the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, the Jews who returned to Israel after the Babylonian captivity energetically rid the community of those who had intermarried with the racially impure remnant left behind. Later, during the period of Greek dominance, there was a struggle between the pro-Greek assimilationists and the more committed Jews, who came to be known as Maccabeans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that time there appeared in Israel a group of renegade Jews, who incited the people. ""Let us enter into a covenant with the Gentiles round about,"" they said, ""because disaster upon disaster has overtaken us since we segregated ourselves from them."" The people thought this a good argument, and some of them in their enthusiasm went to the king and received authority to introduce non-Jewish laws and customs. They built a sports stadium in the gentile style in Jerusalem. They removed their marks of circumcision and repudiated the holy covenant. They intermarried with Gentiles, and abandoned themselves to evil ways.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn4"" id=""ffn4"">[4]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The victory of the Maccabeans reestablished Jewish law and put an end to assimilation. The Book of Jubilees, written during this period, represents the epitome of ancient Jewish nationalism, in which God represents the national interests of the Jewish people in dominating all other peoples of the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the God who created heaven and earth. I shall increase you, and multiply you exceedingly; and kings shall come from you and shall rule wherever the foot of the sons of man has trodden. I shall give to your seed all the earth which is under heaven, and they shall rule over all the nations according to their desire; and afterwards they shall draw the whole earth to themselves and shall inherit it forever.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn5"" id=""ffn5"">[5]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A corollary of this is that throughout history in times of trouble there has been an upsurge in religious fundamentalism, mysticism, and messianism.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn6"" id=""ffn6"">[6]</a></sup> For example, during the 1930s in Germany liberal Reform Jews became more conscious of their Jewish identity, increased their attendance at synagogue, and returned to more traditional observance (including a reintroduction of Hebrew). Many of them became Zionists.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn7"" id=""ffn7"">[7]</a></sup> As I will discuss in the following, every crisis in Israel has resulted in an increase in Jewish identity and intense mobilization of support for Israel. Today the people who are being rooted out of the Jewish community are Jews living in the Diaspora who do not support the aims of the Likud Party in Israel. The overall argument here is that Zionism is an example of the trajectory of Jewish radicalism. The radical movement begins among the more committed segments of the Jewish community, then spreads and eventually becomes mainstream within the Jewish community; then the most extreme continue to push the envelope (e.g., the settlement movement on the West Bank), and other Jews eventually follow because the more extreme positions come to define the essence of Jewish identity. An important part of the dynamic is that Jewish radicalism tends to result in conflicts with non-Jews, with the result that Jews feel threatened, become more group-oriented, and close ranks against the enemy—an enemy seen as irrationally and incomprehensibly anti-Jewish. Jews who fail to go along with what is now a mainstream position are pushed out of the community, labeled ""self-hating Jews"" or worse, and relegated to impotence.</p>
<h2>Table 1: Jewish Radicals Eventually Triumph Within the Jewish Community: The Case of Zionism</h2>
<ol>
<li>Zionism began among the more ethnocentric, committed segments of the Jewish community (1880s).</li>
<li>Then it spread and became mainstream within the Jewish community despite its riskiness (1940s). Supporting Zionism comes to define what being Jewish is.</li>
<li>Then the most extreme among the Zionists continued to push the envelope (e.g., the settlement movement on the West Bank; constant pressure on border areas in Israel).</li>
<li>Jewish radicalism tends to result in conflicts with non-Jews (e.g., the settlement movement); violence (e.g., Intifadas) and other expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment increase.</li>
<li>Jews in general feel threatened and close ranks against what they see as yet another violent, incomprehensible manifestation of the eternally violent hatred of Jews. This reaction is the result of psychological mechanisms of ethnocentrism: moral particularism, self-deception, and social identity.</li>
<li>In the U.S., this effect is accentuated because committed, more intensely ethnocentric Jews dominate Jewish activist groups.</li>
<li>Jews who fail to go along with what is now a mainstream position are pushed out of the community, labeled ""self-hating Jews"" or worse, and relegated to impotence.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Origins of Zionism in Ethnic Conflict in Eastern Europe</h2>
<p>The origins of Zionism and other manifestations of the intense Jewish dynamism of the twentieth century lie in the Yiddish-speaking world of Eastern Europe in the early nineteenth century. Originally invited in by nobles as estate managers, toll farmers, bankers, and moneylenders, Jews in Poland expanded into commerce and then into artisanry, so that there came to be competition between Jews and non-Jewish butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, shoemakers, and tailors. This produced the typical resource-based anti-Jewish attitudes and behavior so common throughout Jewish history.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn8"" id=""ffn8"">[8]</a></sup> Despite periodic restrictions and outbursts of hostility, Jews came to dominate the entire economy apart from agricultural labor and the nobility. Jews had an advantage in the competition in trade and artisanry because they were able to control the trade in raw materials and sell at lower prices to coethnics.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn9"" id=""ffn9"">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>This increasing economic domination went along with a great increase in the population of Jews. Jews not only made up large percentages of urban populations, they increasingly migrated to small towns and rural areas. In short, Jews had overshot their economic niche: The economy was unable to support this burgeoning Jewish population in the sorts of positions that Jews had traditionally filled, with the result that a large percentage of the Jewish population became mired in poverty. The result was a cauldron of ethnic hostility, with the government placing various restrictions on Jewish economic activity; rampant anti-Jewish attitudes; and increasing Jewish desperation.</p>
<p>The main Jewish response to this situation was an upsurge of fundamentalist extremism that coalesced in the Hasidic movement and, later in the nineteenth century, into political radicalism and Zionism as solutions to Jewish problems. Jewish populations in Eastern Europe had the highest rate of natural increase of any European population in the nineteenth century, with a natural increase of 120,000 per year in the 1880s and an overall increase within the Russian Empire from one to six million in the course of the nineteenth century.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn10"" id=""ffn10"">[10]</a></sup> Anti-Semitism and the exploding Jewish population, combined with economic adversity, were of critical importance for producing the sheer numbers of disaffected Jews who dreamed of deliverance in various messianic move-ments—the ethnocentric mysticism of the Kabbala, Zionism, or the dream of a Marxist political revolution.</p>
<p>Religious fanaticism and messianic expectations have been a typical Jewish response to hard times throughout history.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn11"" id=""ffn11"">[11]</a></sup> For example, in the eighteenth-century Ottoman Empire there was ""an unmistakable picture of grinding poverty, ignorance, and insecurity”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn12"" id=""ffn12"">[12]</a></sup> among Jews that, in the context of high levels of anti-Semitism, effectively prevented Jewish upward mobility. These phenomena were accompanied by the prevalence of mysticism and a high fertility rate among Jews, which doubtlessly exacerbated the problems.</p>
<p>The Jewish population explosion in Eastern Europe in the context of poverty and politically imposed restrictions on Jews was responsible for the generally destabilizing effects of Jewish radicalism in Eastern Europe and Russia up to the revolution. These conditions also had spillover effects in Germany, where the negative attitudes toward the immigrant <em>Ostjuden</em> (Eastern Jews) and their foreign, clannish ways contributed to the anti-Semitism of the period.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn13"" id=""ffn13"">[13]</a></sup> In the United States, radical political beliefs held by a great many Jewish immigrants and their descendants persisted even in the absence of difficult economic and political conditions and have had a decisive influence on U.S. political and cultural history into the present. The persistence of these beliefs influenced the general political sensibility of the Jewish community and has had a destabilizing effect on American society, ranging from the paranoia of the McCarthy era to the triumph of the 1960s countercultural revolution.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn14"" id=""ffn14"">[14]</a></sup> In the contemporary world, the descendants of these religious fundamentalists constitute the core of the settler movement and other manifestations of Zionist extremism in Israel.</p>
<p>The hypothesis pursued here is that Jewish population dynamics beginning in the nineteenth century resulted in a feed-forward dynamic: Increasing success in economic competition led to increased population. This in turn led to anti-Jewish reactions and eventually to Jewish overpopulation, poverty, anti-Jewish hostility, and religious fanaticism as a response to external threat. In this regard, Jewish populations are quite the opposite of European populations, in which there is a long history of curtailing reproduction in the face of perceived scarcity of resources.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn15"" id=""ffn15"">[15]</a></sup> This may be analyzed in terms of the individualism collectivism dimension, which provides a general contrast between Jewish and European culture:<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn16"" id=""ffn16"">[16]</a></sup> Individualists curtail reproduction in response to adversity in order to better their own lives, whereas a group-oriented culture such as Judaism responds to adversity by strengthening group ties; forming groups with charismatic leaders and a strong sense of ingroup and outgroup; adopting mystical, messianic ideologies; and increasing their fertility—all of which lead to greater conflict.</p>
<p>There is an association between religious or ethnic fanaticism and fertility, and it is quite common for competing ethnic groups to increase their fertility in response to perceived external threats.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn17"" id=""ffn17"">[17]</a></sup> Ethnic activists respond to the perceived need to increase the numbers of their group in several ways, including exhorting coethnics to reproduce early and often, banning birth control and abortions, curtailing female employment in order to free women for the task of reproducing, and providing financial incentives. In the contemporary world, Jewish activists both within Israel and in the Diaspora have been strong advocates of increasing Jewish fertility, motivated by the threat of intermarriage in the Diaspora, the threat of wars with Israel's neighbors, and as a reaction to Jewish population losses stemming from the Holocaust. Pro-natalism has deep religious significance for Jews as a religious commandment.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn18"" id=""ffn18"">[18]</a></sup> Within Israel, there is ""a nationwide obsession with fertility,” as indicated by the highest rate of in-vitro fertilization clinics in the world—one for every 28,000 citizens. This is more than matched by the Palestinians. Originating in the same group-oriented, collectivist culture area as the Jews, the Palestinians have the highest birth rate in the world and have been strongly attracted to charismatic leaders, messianic religious ideology, and desperate, suicidal solutions for their political problems.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn19"" id=""ffn19"">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>For the Jews, the religious fundamentalism characteristic of Eastern Europe from around 1800-1940 has been a demographic wellspring for Judaism. Jewish populations in the West have tended to have low fertility. Beginning in the nineteenth century, Western Jewish populations would have stagnated or declined in the absence of ""the unending stream of immigrants from Jewish communities in the East.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn20"" id=""ffn20"">[20]</a></sup> But the point here is that this demographic wellspring created the stresses and strains within this very talented and energetic population that continue to reverberate in the modern world.</p>
<p>These trends can be seen by describing the numerically dominant Hasidic population in early nineteenth-century Galicia, then a province of the Austro-Hungarian empire; similar phenomena occurred throughout the Yiddish-speaking, religiously fundamentalist culture area of Eastern Europe, most of which came to be governed by the Russian empire.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn21"" id=""ffn21"">[21]</a></sup> Beginning in the late eighteenth century, there were increasing restrictions on Jewish economic activity, such as edicts preventing Jews from operating taverns, engaging in trade, and leasing mills. There were restrictions on where Jews could live, and ghettos were established in order to remove Jews from competition with non-Jews; taxes specific to Jews were imposed; there were government efforts to force Jewish assimilation, as by requiring the legal documents be in the German language. These laws, even though often little enforced, reflected the anti-Jewish animosity of wider society and undoubtedly increased Jewish insecurity. In any case, a large percentage of the Jewish population was impoverished and doubtless would have remained so even in the absence of anti-Jewish attitudes and legislation. Indeed, the emigration of well over three million Jews to Western Europe and the New World did little to ease the grinding poverty of a large majority of the Jewish population.</p>
<p>It was in this atmosphere that Hasidism rose to dominance in Eastern Europe. The Hasidim passionately rejected all the assimilatory pressures coming from the government. They so cherished the Yiddish language that well into the twentieth century the vast majority of Eastern European Jews could not speak the languages of the non-Jews living around them.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn22"" id=""ffn22"">[22]</a></sup> They turned to the Kabbala (the writings of Jewish mystics), superstition, and anti-rationalism, believing in ""magical remedies, amulets, exorcisms, demonic possession (dybbuks), ghosts, devils, and teasing, mischievous genies.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn23"" id=""ffn23"">[23]</a></sup> Corresponding to this intense ingroup feeling were attitudes that non-Jews were less than human. ""As Mendel of Rymanów put it, ‘A Gentile does not have a heart, although he has an organ that resembles a heart.’”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn24"" id=""ffn24"">[24]</a></sup> All nations exist only by virtue of the Jewish people: ""Erez Yisreal [the land of Israel] is the essence of the world and all vitality stems from it.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn25"" id=""ffn25"">[25]</a></sup> Similar attitudes are common among contemporary Jewish fundamentalists and the settler movement in Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn26"" id=""ffn26"">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Hasidim had an attitude of absolute faith in the person of the <em>zaddic</em>, their rebbe, who was a charismatic figure seen by his followers literally as the personification of God in the world. Attraction to charismatic leaders is a fundamental feature of Jewish social organization—apparent as much among religious fundamentalists as among Jewish political radicals or elite Jewish intellectuals.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn27"" id=""ffn27"">[27]</a></sup> The following account of a scene at a synagogue in Galicia in 1903 describes the intense emotionality of the community and its total subordination to its leader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were no benches, and several thousand Jews were standing closely packed together, swaying in prayer like the corn in the wind. When the rabbi appeared the service began. Everybody tried to get as close to him as possible. The rabbi led the prayers in a thin, weeping voice. It seemed to arouse a sort of ecstasy in the listeners. They closed their eyes, violently swaying. The loud praying sounded like a gale. Anyone seeing these Jews in prayer would have concluded that they were the most religious people on earth.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn28"" id=""ffn28"">[28]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the service, those closest to the rabbi were intensely eager to eat any food touched by him, and the fish bones were preserved by his followers as relics. Another account notes that ""devotees hoping to catch a spark from this holy fire run to receive him.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn29"" id=""ffn29"">[29]</a></sup> The power of the zaddic extends so far ""that whatever God does, it is also within the capacity of the zaddic to do.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn30"" id=""ffn30"">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>An important role for the zaddic is to produce wealth for the Jews, and by taking it from the non-Jews. According to Hasidic doctrine, the non-Jews have the preponderance of good things, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was the zaddic who was to reverse this situation. Indeed, R. Meir of Opatów never wearied of reiterating in his homilies that the zaddik must direct his prayer in a way that the abundance which he draws down from on high should not be squandered during its descent, and not ""wander away,” that is, outside, to the Gentiles, but that it mainly reach the Jews, the holy people, with only a residue flowing to the Gentiles, who are ""the other side” (Satan's camp).<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn31"" id=""ffn31"">[31]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The zaddics' sermons were filled with pleas for vengeance and hatred toward the non-Jews, who were seen as the source of their problems.</p>
<p>These groups were highly authoritarian—another fundamental feature of Jewish social organization.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn32"" id=""ffn32"">[32]</a></sup> Rabbis and other elite members of the community had extraordinary power over other Jews in traditional societies—literally the power of life and death. Jews who informed the authorities about the illegal activities of other Jews were liquidated on orders of secret rabbinical courts, with no opportunity to defend themselves. Jews accused of heretical religious views were beaten or murdered. Their books were burned or buried in cemeteries. When a heretic died, his body was beaten by a special burial committee, placed in a cart filled with dung, and deposited outside the Jewish cemetery. In places where the authorities were lax, there were often pitched battles between different Jewish sects, often over trivial religious points such as what kind of shoes a person should wear. In 1838 the governor of southwestern Russia issued a directive that the police keep tabs on synagogues because ""Very often something happens that leaves dead Jews in its wake.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn33"" id=""ffn33"">[33]</a></sup> Synagogues had jails near the entrance, and prisoners were physically abused by the congregation as they filed in for services.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, these groups had extraordinary solidarity; a government official observed, ""The Hasidim are bound to each other with heart and soul.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn34"" id=""ffn34"">[34]</a></sup> This solidarity was based not only on the personality of the rebbe and the powerful social controls described above, but on the high levels of within-group generosity which alleviated to some extent their poverty. Needless to say, Hasidic solidarity was seen as threatening by outsiders: ""How much longer will we tolerate the Hasidic sect, which is united by such a strong bond and whose members help one another.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn35"" id=""ffn35"">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hasidism triumphed partly by its attraction to the Jewish masses and partly because of the power politics of the rebbes: Opposing rabbis were forced out, so by the early nineteenth century in Galicia, Poland, and the Ukraine, the vast majority of Jews were in Hasidic communities. Their triumph meant the failure of the Jewish Enlightenment (the <em>Haskalah</em>) in Eastern Europe. The Haskalah movement advocated greater assimilation with non-Jewish society, as by using vernacular languages, studying secular subjects, and not adopting distinguishing forms of dress, although in other ways their commitment to Judaism remained powerful. These relatively assimilated Jews were the relatively thin upper crust of wealthy merchants and others who were free of the economic and social pressures that fueled Hasidism. They often cooperated with the authorities in attempts to force the Hasidim to assimilate out of fear that Hasidic behavior led to anti-Jewish attitudes.</p>
<p>As noted above, one source of the inward unity and psychological fanaticism of Jewish communities was the hostility of the surrounding non-Jewish population. Jews in the Russian Empire were hated by all the non-Jewish classes, who saw them as an exploitative class of petty traders, middlemen, innkeepers, store owners, estate agents, and money lenders.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn36"" id=""ffn36"">[36]</a></sup> Jews ""were viewed by the authorities and by much of the rest of population as a foreign, separate, exploitative, and distressingly prolific nation.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn37"" id=""ffn37"">[37]</a></sup> In 1881 these tensions boiled over into several anti-Jewish pogroms in a great many towns of southern and southwestern Russia. It was in this context that the first large-scale stirrings of Zionism emerged.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn38"" id=""ffn38"">[38]</a></sup> From 1881-1884, dozens of Zionist groups formed in the Russian Empire and Romania.</p>
<p>Political radicalism emerged from the same intensely Jewish communities during this period and for much the same reasons.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn39"" id=""ffn39"">[39]</a></sup> Political radicalism often coexisted with messianic forms of Zionism as well as intense commitment to Jewish nationalism and religious and cultural separatism, and many individuals held various and often rapidly changing combinations of these ideas.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn40"" id=""ffn40"">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The two streams of political radicalism and Zionism, each stemming from the teeming fanaticism of threatened Jewish populations in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe, continue to reverberate in the modern world. In both England and America the immigration of Eastern European Jews after 1880 had a transformative effect on the political attitudes of the Jewish community in the direction of radical politics and Zionism, often combined with religious orthodoxy.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn41"" id=""ffn41"">[41]</a></sup> The immigrant Eastern European Jews demographically swamped the previously existing Jewish communities in both countries, and the older community reacted to this influx with considerable trepidation because of the possibility of increased anti-Semitism. Attempts were made by the established Jewish communities to misrepresent the prevalence of radical political ideas and Zionism among the immigrants.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn42"" id=""ffn42"">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Zionist and radical solutions for Jewish problems differed, of course, with the radicals blaming the Jewish situation on the economic structure of society and attempting to appeal to non-Jews in an effort to completely restructure social and economic relationships. (Despite attempting to appeal to non-Jews, the vast majority of Jewish radicals had a very strong Jewish communal identity and often worked in an entirely Jewish milieu.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn43"" id=""ffn43"">[43]</a></sup>) Among Zionists, on the other hand, it was common from very early on to see the Jewish situation as resulting from irresoluble conflict between Jews and non-Jews. The early Zionist Moshe Leib Lilienblum emphasized that Jews were strangers who competed with local peoples: ""A stranger can be received into a family, but only as a guest. A guest who bothers, or competes with or displaces an authentic member of the household is promptly and angrily reminded of his status by the others, acting out of a sense of self-protection.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn44"" id=""ffn44"">[44]</a></sup> Later, Theodor Herzl argued that a prime source of modern anti-Semitism was that Jews had come into direct economic competition with the non-Jewish middle classes. Anti-Semitism based on resource competition was rational: Herzl ""insisted that one could not expect a majority to ‘let themselves be subjugated' by formerly scorned outsiders whom they had just released from the ghetto.... I find the anti-Semites are fully within their rights.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn45"" id=""ffn45"">[45]</a></sup> In Germany, Zionists analyzed anti-Semitism during the Weimar period as ""the inevitable and justifiable response of one people to attempts by another to make it share in the formation of its destiny. It was an instinctive response independent of reason and will, and hence common to all peoples, the Jews included.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn46"" id=""ffn46"">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>As was often the case during the period, Zionists had a much clearer understanding of their fellow Jews and the origins of anti-Jewish attitudes. Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, a prominent Zionist and leader of the American Jewish Congress, whose membership derived from Eastern Europe immigrants and their descendants, accused Western European Jews of deception by pretending to be patriotic citizens while really being Jewish nationalists: ""They wore the mask of the ruling nationality as of old in Spain—the mask of the ruling religion.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn47"" id=""ffn47"">[47]</a></sup> Wise had a well-developed sense of dual loyalty, stating on one occasion ""I am not an American citizen of Jewish faith. I am a Jew. I am an American. I have been an American 63/64ths of my life, but I have been a Jew for 4000 years.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn48"" id=""ffn48"">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Zionists in Western countries were also at the ethnocentric end of the Jewish population. Zionism was seen as a way of combating the assimilatory pressures of Western societies: ""Zionist ideologues and publicists argued that in the West assimilation was as much a threat to the survival of the Jewish people as persecution was in the East.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn49"" id=""ffn49"">[49]</a></sup> Zionism openly accepted a national/ethnic conceptualization of Judaism that was quite independent of religious faith. As Theodore Herzl stated, ""We are a people—one people.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn50"" id=""ffn50"">[50]</a></sup> The Zionist Arthur Hertzberg stated that ""the Jews in all ages were essentially a nation and...all other factors profoundly important to the life of this people, even religion, were mainly instrumental values.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn51"" id=""ffn51"">[51]</a></sup> There were a number of Zionist racial scientists in the period from 1890-1940, including Elias Auerbach, Aron Sandler, Felix Theilhaber, and Ignaz Zollschan. Zionist racial scientists were motivated by a perceived need to end Jewish intermarriage and preserve Jewish racial purity.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn52"" id=""ffn52"">[52]</a></sup> Only by creating a Jewish homeland and leaving the assimilatory influences of the Diaspora could Jews preserve their unique racial heritage.</p>
<p>For example, Auerbach advocated Zionism because it would return Jews ""back into the position they enjoyed before the nineteenth century—politically autonomous, culturally whole, and racially pure.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn53"" id=""ffn53"">[53]</a></sup> Zollschan, whose book on ""the Jewish racial question” went through five editions and was well known to both Jewish and non-Jewish anthropologists,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn54"" id=""ffn54"">[54]</a></sup> praised Houston Stewart Chamberlain and advocated Zionism as the only way to retain Jewish racial purity from the threat of mixed marriages and assimilation.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn55"" id=""ffn55"">[55]</a></sup> Zollschan's description of the phenotypic, and by implication genetic commonality of Jews around the world is striking. He notes that the same Jewish faces can be seen throughout the Jewish world among Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Oriental Jews. He also remarked on the same mix of body types, head shapes, skin, and hair and eye pigmentation in these widely separated groups.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn56"" id=""ffn56"">[56]</a></sup> </p>
<p>For many Zionists, Jewish racialism went beyond merely asserting and shoring up the ethnic basis of Judaism, to embrace the idea of racial superiority. Consistent with the anti-assimilationist thrust of Zionism, very few Zionists intermarried, and those who did, such as Martin Buber, found that their marriages were problematic within the wider Zionist community.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn57"" id=""ffn57"">[57]</a></sup> In 1929 the Zionist leaders of the Berlin Jewish community condemned intermarriage as a threat to the ""racial purity of stock” and asserted its belief that ""consanguinity of the flesh and solidarity of the soul” were essential for developing a Jewish nation, as was the ""will to establish a closed brotherhood over against all other communities on earth.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn58"" id=""ffn58"">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Assertions of Zionist racialism continued into the National Socialist period, where they dovetailed with National Socialist attitudes. Joachim Prinz, a German Jew who later became the head of the American Jewish Congress, celebrated Hitler's ascent to power because it signaled the end of the Enlightenment values, which had resulted in assimilation and mixed marriage among Jews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want assimilation to be replaced by a new law: the declaration of belonging to <em>the Jewish nation and the Jewish race</em>. A state built upon the principle of the purity of nation and race can only be honoured and respected by a Jew who declares his belonging to his own kind.... For only he who honours his <em>own</em> breed and his <em>own</em> blood can have an attitude of honour towards the <em>national will of other nations</em>.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn59"" id=""ffn59"">[59]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The common ground of the racial Zionists and their non-Jewish counterparts included the exclusion of Jews from the German <em>Volksgemeinschaft</em>.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn60"" id=""ffn60"">[60]</a></sup> Indeed, shortly after Hitler came to power, the Zionist Federation of Germany submitted a memorandum to the German government outlining a solution to the Jewish question and containing the following remarkable statement. The Federation declared that the Enlightenment view that Jews should be absorbed into the nation state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>discerned only the individual, the single human being freely suspended in space, without regarding the ties of blood and history or spiritual distinctiveness. Accordingly, the liberal state demanded of the Jews assimilation [via baptism and mixed marriage] into the non-Jewish environment.... Thus it happened that innumerable persons of Jewish origin had the chance to occupy important positions and to come forward as representatives of German culture and German life, without having their belonging to Jewry become visible. Thus arose a state of affairs which in political discussion today is termed ""debasement of Germandom,” or ""Jewification.”.. .Zionism has no illusions about the difficulty of the Jewish condition, which consists above all in an abnormal occupational pattern and in the fault of an intellectual and moral posture not rooted in one's own tradition.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn61"" id=""ffn61"">[61]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Zionism As a ""Risky Strategy""</h2>
<p>Zionism was a risky strategy—to use Frank Salter's term<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn62"" id=""ffn62"">[62]</a></sup>—because it led to charges of dual loyalty. The issue of dual loyalty has been a major concern throughout the history of Zionism. From the beginnings of Zionism, the vast majority of the movement's energy and numbers, and eventually its leadership, stemmed from the Eastern European wellspring of Judaism.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn63"" id=""ffn63"">[63]</a></sup> In the early decades of the twentieth century, there was a deep conflict within the Jewish communities of Western Europe and the U.S., pitting the older Jewish communities originating in Western Europe (particularly Germany) against the new arrivals from Eastern Europe, who eventually overwhelmed them by force of numbers.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn64"" id=""ffn64"">[64]</a></sup> Thus, an important theme of the history of Jews in America, England, and Germany was the conflict between the older Jewish communities that were committed to some degree of cultural assimilation and the ideals of the Enlightenment, versus the Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Eastern Europe and their commitment to political radicalism, Zionism, and/or religious fundamentalism. The older Jewish communities were concerned that Zionism would lead to anti-Semitism due to charges of dual loyalty and because Jews would be perceived as a nation and an ethnic group rather than simply as a religion. In England, during the final stages before the issuance of the Balfour Declaration, Edwin Montagu ""made a long, emotional appeal to his colleagues [in the British cabinet]: how could he represent the British government during the forthcoming mission to India if the same government declared that his (Montagu's) national home was on Turkish territory?”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn65"" id=""ffn65"">[65]</a></sup> Similar concerns were expressed in the United States, but by 1937 most American Jews advocated a Jewish state, and the Columbus Platform of the Reform Judaism of 1937 officially accepted the idea of a Palestinian homeland and shortly thereafter accepted the idea of political sovereignty for Jews in Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn66"" id=""ffn66"">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>In post—World War I Germany, a major goal of Reform Judaism was to suppress Zionism because of its perceived effect of fanning the flames of anti-Semitism due to charges of Jewish disloyalty.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn67"" id=""ffn67"">[67]</a></sup> In <em>Mein Kampf</em>, Hitler argued that Jews were an ethnic group and not simply a religion, which was confirmed by his discovery that ""among them was a great movement...which came out sharply in confirmation of the national character of the Jews: this was the <em>Zionists</em>.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn68"" id=""ffn68"">[68]</a></sup> Hitler went on to remark that although one might suppose that only a subset of Jews were Zionists and that Zionism was condemned by the great majority of Jews, ""the so-called liberal Jews did not reject Zionists as non-Jews, but only as Jews with an impractical, perhaps even dangerous, way of publicly avowing their Jewishness. Intrinsically they remained unalterably of one piece.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn69"" id=""ffn69"">[69]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Hitler's comments reflect the weak position of the Zionists of his day as a small minority of Jews, but they also show the reality of the worst fears of the German Reform movement during this period: that the publicly expressed ethnocentric nationalism of the Zionists would increase anti-Semitism, because Jews would be perceived not as a religious group but as an ethnic/national entity with no ties to Germany. The existence of Zionism as well as of international Jewish organizations such as the Alliance Israélite Universelle (based in France) and continued Jewish cultural separatism were important sources of German anti-Semitism beginning in the late nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, Stalin regarded Jews as politically unreliable after they expressed ""overwhelming enthusiasm"" for Israel and attempted to emigrate to Israel, especially since Israel was leaning toward the West in the Cold War.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn70"" id=""ffn70"">[70]</a></sup> During the fighting in 1948, Soviet Jews attempted to organize an army to fight in Israel, and there were a great many other manifestations of Soviet-Jewish solidarity with Israel, particularly in the wake of Jewish enthusiasm during Golda Meir's visit to the Soviet Union. Stalin perceived a ""psychological readiness on the part of the volunteers to be under the jurisdiction of two states—the homeland of all the workers and the homeland of all the Jews—something that was categorically impossible in his mind.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn71"" id=""ffn71"">[71]</a></sup> There is also some indication that Stalin, at the height of the Cold War, suspected that Soviet Jews would not be loyal to the Soviet Union in a war with America because many of them had relatives in America.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn72"" id=""ffn72"">[72]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, the dual loyalty issue arose because there was a conflict between perceived American foreign policy interests that began with the Balfour Declaration of 1917. The U. S. State Department feared that a British protectorate in Palestine would damage commercial interests in the region and that in any case it was not in the interests of America to offend Turkey or other Middle Eastern states.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn73"" id=""ffn73"">[73]</a></sup> While President Woodrow Wilson sympathized with the State Department position, he was eventually persuaded by American Zionists, notably Louis Brandeis, to endorse the declaration; it was then quickly approved by the British.</p>
<p>The dual loyalty issue was also raised in Britain, most especially after the Second World War, when the Labour government failed to support the creation of a Jewish state. Many British Jews gave generously to finance illegal activities in the British protectorate of Palestine, including the smuggling of arms and refugees and Jewish attacks on British forces.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn74"" id=""ffn74"">[74]</a></sup> British losses to Jewish terrorism during this period were not trivial: The bombing of the King David Hotel by future Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his associates led to the deaths of eighty-three of the British administrative staff plus five members of the public. These activities led to widespread hostility toward Jews, and the Labour government pointedly refused to outlaw anti-Semitism during this period. During the late 1960s and 1970s, charges of dual loyalty appeared in the House of Commons among Labour MPs, one of whom commented that ""it is undeniable that many MPs have what I can only term a dual loyalty, which is to another nation and another nation's interests.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn75"" id=""ffn75"">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>Attitudes ranging from unenthusiastic ambivalence to outright hostility to the idea of a Zionist homeland on the part of presidents, the State Department, Congress, or the American public persisted right up until the establishment of Israel in 1948 and beyond. After World War II, there continued to be a perception in the State Department that American interests in the area would not be served by a Jewish homeland, but should be directed at securing oil and military bases to oppose the Soviets. There was also concern that such a homeland would be a destabilizing influence for years to come because of Arab hostility.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn76"" id=""ffn76"">[76]</a></sup> Truman's defense secretary, James Forrestal, ""was all but obsessed by the threat to [American interests] he discerned in Zionist ambitions. His concern was shared by the State Department and specifically by the Near East Desk.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn77"" id=""ffn77"">[77]</a></sup> In 1960 Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared in response to attempts to coerce Egypt into agreeing to Israel's use of the Suez Canal, ""in recent years we have seen the rise of organizations dedicated apparently not to America, but to foreign states and groups. The conduct of a foreign policy for America has been seriously compromised by this development.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn78"" id=""ffn78"">[78]</a></sup> Truman himself eventually caved in to Zionist pressure out of desire to ensure Jewish support in the 1948 election, and despite his own recently revealed personal misgivings about Jewish myopia in pursuit of their own interests.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn79"" id=""ffn79"">[79]</a></sup> </p>
<h2>Zionist Extremism Becomes Mainstream</h2>
<p>Since the Second World War, there has been a long evolution such that the American Jewish community now fully supports the settler movement and other right-wing causes within Israel. Zionists made a great deal of progress during the Second World War. They engaged in ""loud diplomacy,” organizing thousands of rallies, dinners with celebrity speakers (including prominent roles for sympathetic non-Jews), letter-writing campaigns, meetings, lobbying, threats against newspapers for publishing unfavorable items, insertion of propaganda as news items in the press, and giving money to politicians and non-Jewish celebrities in return for their support.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn80"" id=""ffn80"">[80]</a></sup> By 1944, thousands of non-Jewish associations would pass pro-Zionist resolutions, and both Republican and Democratic platforms included strong pro-Zionist planks, even though the creation of a Jewish state was strongly opposed by the Departments of State and War.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn81"" id=""ffn81"">[81]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A 1945 poll found that 80.5% of Jews favored a Jewish state, with only 10.5% opposed.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn82"" id=""ffn82"">[82]</a></sup> This shows that by the end of the Second World War, Zionism had become thoroughly mainstream within the U.S. Jewish community. The triumph of Zionism occurred well before consciousness of the Holocaust came to be seen as legitimizing Israel. (Michael Novick dates the promotion of the Holocaust to its present status as a cultural icon from the 1967 Six-Day War.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn83"" id=""ffn83"">[83]</a></sup>) What had once been radical and viewed as dangerous had become not only accepted, but seen as central to Jewish identity.</p>
<p>Since the late 1980s, the American Jewish community has not been even-handed in its support of Israeli political factions, but has supported the more fanatical elements within Israel. While wealthy Israelis predominantly support the Labor Party, financial support for Likud and other right-wing parties comes from foreign sources, particularly wealthy U.S. Jews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn84"" id=""ffn84"">[84]</a></sup> The support of these benefactors is endangered by any softening of Likud positions, with support then going to the settler movement. ""Organized U.S. Jews are chauvinistic and militaristic in their views.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn85"" id=""ffn85"">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>Within Israel, there has been a transformation in the direction of the most radical, ethnocentric, and aggressive elements of the population. During the 1920s-1940s, the followers of Vladimir Jabotinsky (the ""Revisionists”) were the vanguard of Zionist aggressiveness and strident racial nationalism, but they were a minority within the Zionist movement as a whole. Revisionism had several characteristics typical of influential nineteenth-century Jewish intellectual and political movements—features shared also with other forms of traditional Judaism. Like Judaism itself and the various hermeneutic theories typical of other Jewish twentieth-century intellectual movements, the philosophy of Revisionism was a closed system that offered a complete worldview ""creating a self-evident Jewish world.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn86"" id=""ffn86"">[86]</a></sup> Like the Hasidic movement and other influential Jewish intellectual and political movements, Revisionism was united around a charismatic leader figure, in this case Jabotinsky, who was seen in god-like terms—""Everyone waited for him to speak, clung to him for support, and considered him the source of the one and only absolute truth.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn87"" id=""ffn87"">[87]</a></sup> There was a powerful sense of ""us versus them.” Opponents were demonized: ""The style of communication...was coarse and venomous, aimed at moral delegitimization of the opponent by denouncing him and even ‘inciting' the Jewish public against him.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn88"" id=""ffn88"">[88]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jabotinsky developed a form of racial nationalism similar to other Zionist racial theorists of the period (see above). He believed that Jews were shaped by their long history as a desert people and that establishment of Israel as a Jewish state would allow the natural genius of the Jewish race to flourish. ""These natural and fundamental distinctions embedded in the race are impossible to eradicate, and are continually being nurtured by the differences in soil and climate.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn89"" id=""ffn89"">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Revisionists advocated military force as a means of obtaining a Jewish state; they wanted a ""maximalist"" state that would include the entire Palestine Mandate, including the Trans-Jordan (which became the nation of Jordan in 1946).<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn90"" id=""ffn90"">[90]</a></sup> In the 1940s, its paramilitary wing, the Irgun, under the leadership of Menachem Begin, was responsible for much of the terrorist activities directed against both Arabs and the British forces maintaining the Palestinian Mandate until 1948, including the bombing of the King David Hotel and the massacre at Deir Yasin that was a major factor in terrorizing much of the Palestinian population into fleeing.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn91"" id=""ffn91"">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over time, the Labor Party has dwindled in influence, and there has followed the rise and ascendancy of the Likud Party and ultra-nationalism represented by Begin, who came to power in 1977 and began the process of resurrecting Jabotinsky,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn92"" id=""ffn92"">[92]</a></sup> by Yitzhak Shamir (commander of LEHI [the Stern Group], another pre-1948 terrorist group), and now by the government of Ariel Sharon, whose long record of aggressive brutality is described briefly below. Fundamentalists and other ultranationalists were a relatively weak phenomenon in the 1960s, but have increased to around 25% in the late 1990s and are an integral part of Sharon's government. In other words, the more radical Zionists have won out within Israel. (As Noam Chomsky notes, there has been a consensus on retaining sovereignty over the West Bank, so that the entire Israeli political spectrum must be seen as aggressively expansionist.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn93"" id=""ffn93"">[93]</a></sup> The differences are differences of degree.)</p>
<p>The connections between Jabotinsky and the current Israeli government are more than coincidental: Just before Israel's election in February 2001, Sharon was interviewed seated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>symbolically and ostentatiously beneath a large photo of Vladimir Jabotinsky, spiritual father of militant Zionism and Sharon's Likud party. Jabotinsky called for a Jewish state extending from the Nile to the Euphrates. He advocated constant attacks to smash the weak Arab states into fragments, dominated by Israel. In fact, just what Sharon tried to do in Lebanon. Hardly a good omen for the Mideast's future.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn94"" id=""ffn94"">[94]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharon has been implicated in a long string of acts of ""relentless brutality toward Arabs,"" including massacring an Arab village in the 1950s; the ""pacification"" of the Gaza Strip in the 1970s (involving large-scale bulldozing of homes and deportation of Palestinians); the invasion of Lebanon, which involved thousands of civilian deaths and the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees; and the brutal Israeli response to the recent Palestinian intifada.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn95"" id=""ffn95"">[95]</a></sup> The Kahan Commission, an Israeli board formed to investigate the Lebanese incident, concluded that Sharon was indirectly responsible for the massacre, and it went on to say that Sharon bears personal responsibility.</p>
<p>The intention of the Sharon government is to make life so miserable for the Palestinians that they will voluntarily leave, or, failing that, to simply expel them. Ran HaCohen, an Israeli academic, sums up the situation as of June 2002:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Step by step, Palestinians have been dispossessed and surrounded by settlements, military camps, by-pass roads and checkpoints, squeezed into sealed-off enclaves. Palestinian towns are besieged by tanks and armed vehicles blocking all access roads. West Bank villages too are surrounded by road blocks, preventing the movement of vehicles in and out: three successive mounds of rubble and earth, approximately 6 feet high, with 100 metre gaps between them. All residents wishing to move in and out of the village—old or young, sick or well, pregnant or not—have to climb over the slippery mounds. At present, this policy seems to have been perfected to an extent that it can be further institutionalised by long-term bureaucracy: a permit system, considerably worse than the ""pass laws"" imposed on blacks in Apartheid South Africa.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn96"" id=""ffn96"">[96]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Little has changed since this assessment. Recently this state of affairs is being formalized by the construction of a series of security walls that not only fence in the Palestinians but also result in the effective seizure of land, especially around Jerusalem.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn97"" id=""ffn97"">[97]</a></sup> The wall encircles and isolates Palestinian villages and divides properties and farmland in ways that make them inaccessible to their owners.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn98"" id=""ffn98"">[98]</a></sup></p>
<p>The current state of affairs would have been absolutely predictable simply by paying attention to the pronouncements and behavior of a critical subset of Israeli leaders over the last fifty years. Again, they have been the most radical within the Israeli political spectrum. The clear message is that an important faction of the Israeli political spectrum has had along-term policy of expanding the state at the expense of the Palestinians, dating from the beginnings of the state of Israel. Expansionism was well entrenched in the Labor Party, centered around David Ben-Gurion, and has been even more central to the Likud coalition under the leadership of Menachem Begin and, more recently, Benjamin Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon. The result is that the Palestinians have been left with little hope of obtaining a meaningful state, despite the current ""road map to peace"" efforts. The next step may well be expulsion, already advocated by many on the right in Israel, although the strategy of oppression is in fact causing some Palestinians to leave voluntarily.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn99"" id=""ffn99"">[99]</a></sup> Voluntary emigration has long been viewed as a solution by some, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (on the more ""liberal"" end of the Israeli political spectrum), who urged that Israel ""create...conditions which would attract natural and voluntary migration of the refugees from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to Jordan.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn100"" id=""ffn100"">[100]</a></sup> </p>
<p>""Transfer,"" whether voluntary or involuntary, has long been a fixture of Zionist thought going back to Herzl, Chaim Weizmann, and Ben-Gurion.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn101"" id=""ffn101"">[101]</a></sup> Ben-Gurion wrote in his diary in 1937: ""the compulsory transfer of the Arabs from the valleys of the projected Jewish state...we have to stick to this conclusion the same way we grabbed the Balfour Declaration, more than that, the same way we grabbed at Zionism itself.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn102"" id=""ffn102"">[102]</a></sup> A prominent recent proponent of expulsion is Rehavam Zeevi, a close associate of Sharon and Israel's Minister of Tourism as well as a member of the powerful Security Cabinet until his assassination in October, 2001. Zeevi described Palestinians as ""lice"" and advocated the expulsion of Palestinians from Israeli-controlled areas. Zeevi said Palestinians were living illegally in Israel and ""We should get rid of the ones who are not Israeli citizens the same way you get rid of lice. We have to stop this cancer from spreading within us."" There are many examples, beginning no later than the mid-1980s, of leading Israeli politicians referring to the occupied territories on the West Bank as ""Judea and Samaria.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn103"" id=""ffn103"">[103]</a></sup></p>
<p>The point is that movements that start out on the extreme of the Jewish political spectrum eventually end up driving the entire process, so that in the end not only American Jews but pro-Israeli non-Jewish politicians end up mouthing the rhetoric that was formerly reserved for extremists within the Jewish community. In 2003, at a time when there are well over one hundred Israeli settlements on the West Bank and Gaza filled with fanatic fundamentalists and armed zealots intent on eradicating the Palestinians, it is revealing that Moshe Sharett, Israeli prime minister in the 1950s, worried that the border settlements were composed of well-armed ex-soldiers—extremists who were intent on expanding the borders of Israel. Immediately after the armistice agreement of 1948 Israeli zealots, sometimes within the army and sometimes in the nascent settler movement, began a long string of provocations of Israel's neighbors.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn104"" id=""ffn104"">[104]</a></sup> An operation of the Israeli army (under the leadership of Ariel Sharon) that demolished homes and killed civilians at Kibya in 1953 was part of a broader plan: ""The stronger the tensions in the region, the more demoralized the Arab populations and destabilized the Arab regimes, the stronger the pressures for the transfer of the concentrations of Palestinian refugees from places near the border away into the interior of the Arab world—and the better it was for the preparation of the next war.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn105"" id=""ffn105"">[105]</a></sup> At times the army engaged in provocative actions without Prime Minister Sharett's knowledge,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn106"" id=""ffn106"">[106]</a></sup> as when David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, led a raid in 1955 which resulted in a massacre of Arabs in Gaza. When confronted with his actions by an American Jew, Ben-Gurion ""stood up. He looked like an angry prophet out of the Bible and got red in the face. He shouted, ‘I am not going to let anybody, American Jews or anyone else, tell me what I have to do to provide for the security of my people.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn107"" id=""ffn107"">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>The war to occupy the West Bank did not take place until 1967, but Sharett describes plans by the Israeli army to occupy the West Bank dating from 1953. Throughout the period from 1948-1967 ""some of the major and persistent accusations” by the Israeli right were that the Labor-dominated governments had accepted the partition of Palestine and had not attempted to ""eradicate Palestinian boundaries” during the 1948 war.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn108"" id=""ffn108"">[108]</a></sup> The annexation of East Jerusalem and the settlement of the West Bank began immediately after the 1967 war—exactly what would be expected on the assumption that this was a war of conquest. Menachem Begin, who accelerated the settlement process when he assumed power in 1977, noted, ""In June 1967, we again had a choice. The Egyptian Army concentrations in the Sinai approaches do not prove that [Egyptian President] Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn109"" id=""ffn109"">[109]</a></sup> </p></div></div><div class=""sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image"" data-block-type=""5"" id=""block-yui_3_17_2_11_1429907705990_19516""><div class=""sqs-block-content"">

It is common among radical Zionists to project a much larger Israel that reflects God's covenant with Abraham. Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, maintained that the area of the Jewish state stretches: ""From the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn110"" id=""ffn110"">[110]</a></sup> This reflects God's covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15: 18-20 and Joshua 1: 3-4: ""To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.” The flexibility of the ultimate aims of Zionism can also be seen by Ben-Gurion's comment in 1936 that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acceptance of partition [of the Palestinian Mandate] does not commit us to renounce Transjordan [i.e., the modern state of Jordan]; one does not demand from anybody to give up his vision. We shall accept a state in the boundaries fxed today. But the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people and no external factor will be able to limit them.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn111"" id=""ffn111"">[111]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben-Gurion's vision of ""the boundaries of Zionist aspirations” included southern Lebanon, southern Syria, all of Jordan, and the Sinai.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn112"" id=""ffn112"">[112]</a></sup> (After conquering the Sinai in 1956, Ben-Gurion announced to the Knesset that ""Our army did not infringe on Egyptian territory... Our operations were restricted to the Sinai Peninsula alone.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn113"" id=""ffn113"">[113]</a></sup> Or consider Golda Meir's statement that the borders of Israel ""are where Jews live, not where there is a line on the map.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn114"" id=""ffn114"">[114]</a></sup></p>
<p>These views are common among the more extreme Zionists today—especially the fundamentalists and the settler movement—notably Gush Emunim—who now set the tone in Israel. A prominent rabbi associated with these movements stated: ""We must live in this land even at the price of war. Moreover, even if there is peace, we must instigate wars of liberation in order to conquer [the land].”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn115"" id=""ffn115"">[115]</a></sup> Indeed, in the opinion of Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky, ""It is not unreasonable to assume that Gush Emunim, if it possessed the power and control, would use nuclear weapons in warfare to attempt to achieve its purpose.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn116"" id=""ffn116"">[116]</a></sup> This image of a ""Greater Israel” is also much on the minds of activists in the Muslim world. For example, in a 1998 interview Osama bin Laden stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e know at least one reason behind the symbolic participation of the Western forces [in Saudi Arabia] and that is to support the Jewish and Zionist plans for expansion of what is called the Great Israel.... Their presence has no meaning save one and that is to offer support to the Jews in Palestine who are in need of their Christian brothers to achieve full control over the Arab Peninsula which they intend to make an important part of the so called Greater Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn117"" id=""ffn117"">[117]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To recap: A century ago Zionism was a minority movement within Diaspora Judaism, with the dominant assimilationist Jews in the West opposing it at least partly because Zionism raised the old dual loyalty issue, which has been a potent source of anti-Semitism throughout the ages. The vast majority of Jews eventually became Zionists, to the point that now not only are Diaspora Jews Zionists, they are indispensable supporters of the most fanatic elements within Israel. Within Israel, the radicals have also won the day, and the state has evolved to the point where the influence of moderates in the tradition of Moshe Sharett is a distant memory. The fanatics keep pushing the envelope, forcing other Jews to either go along with their agenda or to simply cease being part of the Jewish community. Not long ago it was common to talk to American Jews who would say they support Israel but deplore the settlements. Now such talk among Jews is an anachronism, because support for Israel demands support for the settlements. The only refuge for such talk is the increasingly isolated Jewish critics of Israel, such as Israel Shamir<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn118"" id=""ffn118"">[118]</a></sup> and, to a much lesser extent, Michael Lerner's <em>Tikkun</em>.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn119"" id=""ffn119"">[119]</a></sup> The trajectory of Zionism has soared from its being a minority within a minority to its dominating the U.S. Congress, the executive branch, and the entire U.S. foreign policy apparatus.</p>
<p>And because the Israeli occupation and large-scale settlement of the West Bank unleashed a wave of terrorist-style violence against Israel, Jews perceive Israel as under threat. As with any committed group, Jewish commitment increases in times of perceived threat to the community. The typical response of Diaspora Jews to the recent violence has not been to renounce Jewish identity but to strongly support the Sharon government and rationalize its actions. This has been typical of Jewish history in general. For example, during the 1967 and 1973 wars there were huge upsurges of support for Israel and strengthened Jewish identity among American Jews: Arthur Hertzberg, a prominent Zionist, wrote that ""the immediate reaction of American Jewry to the crisis was far more intense and widespread than anyone could have foreseen. Many Jews would never have believed that grave danger to Israel could dominate their thoughts and emotions to the exclusion of everything else.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn120"" id=""ffn120"">[120]</a></sup> The same thing is happening now. The typical response to Israel's current situation is for Jews to identify even more strongly with Israel and to exclude Jews who criticize Israel or support Palestinian claims in any way.</p>
<p>This ""rallying around the flag"" in times of crisis fits well with the psychology of ethnocentrism: When under attack, groups become more unified and more conscious of boundaries, and have a greater tendency to form negative stereotypes of the outgroup. This has happened throughout Jewish history.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn121"" id=""ffn121"">[121]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several commentators have noted the void on the Jewish left as the conflict with the Palestinians has escalated under the Sharon government. As noted above, surveys in the 1980s routinely found that half of U.S. Jews opposed settlements on the West Bank and favored a Palestinian state.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn122"" id=""ffn122"">[122]</a></sup> Such sentiments have declined precipitously in the current climate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a progressive synagogue on Manhattan's Upper West Side, Rabbi Rolando Matalo was torn between his longtime support for Palestinian human rights and his support for an Israel under siege. ""There is a definite void on the left,"" said Matalo.... Many American Jewish leaders say Israel's current state of emergency—and growing signs of anti-Semitism around the world—have unified the faithful here in a way not seen since the 1967 and 1973 wars.... These feelings shift back and forth, but right now they're tilting toward tribalism.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn123"" id=""ffn123"">[123]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the author of this article, Josh Getlin, portrays Israel as being ""under siege,"" even though Israel is the occupying power and has killed far more Palestinians than the Palestinians have killed Israelis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”I don't recall a time in modern history when Jews have felt so vulnerable,"" said Rabbi Martin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.... This week, the center will be mailing out 600,000 ""call to action"" brochures that say ""Israel is fighting for her life"" and urge American Jews to contact government leaders and media organizations worldwide.... Rabbi Mark Diamond, executive vice president of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California, said debate over the West Bank invasion and the attack on the Palestinian Jenin refugee camp is overshadowed by ""a strong sense that Israel needs us, that the world Jewry needs us, that this is our wake-up call."" He said he has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by numerous calls from members of synagogues asking what they can do to help or where they can send a check.... ""I have American friends who might have been moderate before on the issue of negotiating peace, but now they think: ‘Our whole survival is at stake, so let's just destroy them all,'"" said Victor Nye, a Brooklyn, N.Y., businessman who describes himself as a passionate supporter of Israel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this atmosphere, Jews who dissent are seen as traitors, and liberal Jews have a great deal of anxiety that they will be ostracized from the Jewish community for criticizing Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn124"" id=""ffn124"">[124]</a></sup> This phenomenon is not new. During the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Richard Cohen of the <em>Washington Post</em> criticized the Begin government and was inundated with protests from Jews. ""Here dissent becomes treason—and treason not to a state or even an ideal (Zionism), but to a people. There is tremendous pressure for conformity, to show a united front and to adopt the view that what is best for Israel is something only the government there can know.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn125"" id=""ffn125"">[125]</a></sup> During the same period, Nat Hentoff noted in the <em>Village Voice</em>, ""I know staff workers for the American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish Congress who agonize about their failure to speak out, even on their own time, against Israeli injustice. They don't, because they figure they'll get fired if they do.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn126"" id=""ffn126"">[126]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reflecting the fact that Jews who advocate peace with the Palestinians are on the defensive, funding has dried up for causes associated with criticism of Israel. The following is a note posted on the website of <em>Tikkun</em> by its editor, Michael Lerner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tikkun Magazine</em> is in trouble—because we have continued to insist on the rights of the Palestinian people to full self-determination. For years we've called for an end to the Occupation and dismantling of the Israeli settlements. We've called on the Palestinian people to follow the example of Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela and Gandhi—and we've critiqued terrorism against Israel, and insisted on Israel's right to security. But we've also critiqued Israel's house demolitions, torture, and grabbing of land. For years, we had much support. But since Intifada II began this past September, many Jews have stopped supporting us—and we've lost subscribers and donors. Would you consider helping us out?<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn127"" id=""ffn127"">[127]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another sign that Jews who are ""soft"" on Israel are being pushed out of the Jewish community is an article by Philip Weiss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The refusal of liberal American Jews to make an independent stand has left the American left helpless. American liberalism has always drawn strength from Jews. They are among the largest contributors to the Democratic Party; they have brought a special perspective to any number of social-justice questions, from the advancement of blacks and women to free speech. They fostered multiculturalism... .</p>
<p>The Holocaust continues to be the baseline reference for Jews when thinking about their relationship to the world, and the Palestinians. A couple of months ago, I got an e-mail from a friend of a friend in Israel about the latest bus-bombing. ""They're going to kill us all,"" was the headline. (No matter that Israel has one of largest armies in the world, and that many more Palestinians have died than Israelis). Once, when I suggested to a liberal journalist friend that Americans had a right to discuss issues involving Jewish success in the American power structure—just as we examined the WASP culture of the establishment a generation ago—he said, ""Well, we know where that conversation ends up: in the ovens of Auschwitz.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn128"" id=""ffn128"">[128]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of Jewish ethnocentrism and group commitment, stories of Jews being killed are seen as the portending of another Holocaust and the extinction of the Jewish people rather than a response to a savage occupation—a clear instance of moral particularism writ large.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening in Canada, where Jews are concerned about declining support by Canadians for Israel. ""The past three years have been extraordinarily tough on Jews in Canada and around the world,"" said Keith Landy, national president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. ""Every Jew has felt under attack in some form.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn129"" id=""ffn129"">[129]</a></sup> The response has been increased activism by deeply committed wealthy Jews, including, most famously, Israel Asper, executive chairman of CanWest Global Communications Corp. Asper has used his media empire to promote pro-Likud policies and has punished journalists for any deviation from its strong pro-Israel editorial policies.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn130"" id=""ffn130"">[130]</a></sup> The efforts of these activists are aimed at consolidating Jewish organizations behind ""hawkish"" attitudes on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Older Jewish organizations, such as the Canada-Israel Committee and the Canadian Jewish Congress, would be remolded or driven out of existence to exclude Jews less committed to these attitudes.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>An important mechanism underlying all this is that of rallying around the flag during times of crisis, a phenomenon that is well understood by social psychologists. Group identification processes are exaggerated in times of resource competition or other perceived sources of threat,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn131"" id=""ffn131"">[131]</a></sup> a finding that is highly compatible with an evolutionary perspective.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn132"" id=""ffn132"">[132]</a></sup> External threat tends to reduce internal divisions and maximize perceptions of common interest among ingroup members, as we have seen among American Jews in response to perceived crises in Israel, ranging from the Six-Day War of 1967 to the unending crises of the 1990s and into the new millennium.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn133"" id=""ffn133"">[133]</a></sup> Jewish populations also respond to threat by developing messianic ideologies, rallying around charismatic leaders, and expelling dissenters from the community. Traditionally this has taken the form of religious fundamentalism, as among the Hasidim, but in the modern world these tendencies have been manifested in various forms of leftist radicalism, Zionism, and other Jewish intellectual and political movements.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn134"" id=""ffn134"">[134]</a></sup> Throughout Jewish history, this siege mentality has tended to increase conflict between Jews and non-Jews. In the context of the intense ethnic conflict of nineteenth-century Eastern Europe, the conflict was exacerbated by an enormous increase in the Jewish population.</p>
<p>And in all cases, the leaders of this process are the more ethnocentric, committed Jews. They are the ones who donate to Jewish causes, attend rallies, write letters, join and support activist organizations. As J. J. Goldberg, the editor of the <em>Forward</em>, notes, Jews who identify themselves as doves feel much less strongly about Israel than those who identify themselves as hawks. ""Jewish liberals give to the Sierra Fund. Jewish conservatives are Jewish all the time. That's the whole ball game. It's not what six million American Jews feel is best—it's what 50 Jewish organizations feel is best.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn135"" id=""ffn135"">[135]</a></sup> In other words, it's the most radical, committed elements of the Jewish community that determine the direction of the entire community.</p>
<p>As a European in a society that is rapidly becoming non-European, I can sympathize with Jabotinsky's envy of the native Slavic peoples he observed in the early twentieth century:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I look at them with envy. I have never known, and probably never will know, this completely organic feeling: so united and singular [is this] sense of a homeland, in which everything flows together, the past and the present, the legend and the hopes, the individual and the historical.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn136"" id=""ffn136"">[136]</a></sup></p>
<p>Every nation, civilised or primitive, sees its land as its national home, where it wants to stay as the sole landlord forever. Such a nation will never willingly consent to new landlords or even to partnership.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn137"" id=""ffn137"">[137]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the memory of this rapidly disappearing sense of historical rootedness and a sense of impending dispossession that are at the root of the malaise experienced by many Europeans, not only in the U.S. but elsewhere. The triumph of Zionism took a mere fifty years from Herzl's inspiration to the founding of the state of Israel. There is a tendency to overlook or ignore the powerful ethnocentrism at the heart of Zionism that motivated people like Jabotinsky, especially on the part of the American Jewish community, which has been dedicated throughout the twentieth century to pathologizing and criminalizing the fragile vestiges of ethnocentrism among Europeans.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn138"" id=""ffn138"">[138]</a></sup> </p>
<p>But the bottom line is that the Zionists were successful. Israel would not have become a state without a great many deeply ethnocentric Jews willing to engage in any means necessary to bring about their dream: a state that would be a vehicle for their ethnic interests. It would not have come about without the most radical among them—people like Jabotinsky, Begin, Shamir, Sharon, and their supporters—a group which now includes the entire organized American Jewish community. The impending dispossession of Europeans will only be avoided if people of their ilk can be found among the political class of Europeans.</p>

<div class=""author-bio""><p>Kevin MacDonald is a retired Professor of  Psychology at California State University–Long Beach. After receiving a Masters degree in evolutionary biology, he received a Ph. D. in Biobehavioral Sciences, both at the University of Connecticut.  Since assuming his position at California State University–Long Beach, his research has focused on developing evolutionary perspectives on culture, developmental psychology and personality theory, the origins and maintenance of monogamous marriage in Western Europe, and ethnic relations (group evolutionary strategies). He is the author of more than 100 scholarly papers and reviews, and he is the author of Social and Personality Development: An Evolutionary Synthesis (1988), A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (1994), Separation and Its Discontents: Toward an Evolutionary Theory of Anti-Semitism (1998), and The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements (1998). He has also edited three books, Sociobiological Perspectives on Human Development (1988), Parent-Child Play: Descriptions and Implications (1994), and Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Development (2004). Cultural Insurrections, a collection of essays, appeared in 2008.

Also important is high intelligence, including the usefulness of intelligence in attaining wealth, prominence in the media, and eminence in the academic world and the legal profession. I will also discuss two other qualities that have received less attention: psychological intensity and aggressiveness.</p>
<p>The four background traits of ethnocentrism, intelligence, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness result in Jews being able to produce formidable, effective groups—groups able to have powerful, transformative effects on the peoples they live among. In the modern world, these traits influence the academic world and the world of mainstream and elite media, thus amplifying Jewish effectiveness compared with traditional societies. However, Jews have repeatedly become an elite and powerful group in societies in which they reside in sufficient numbers. It is remarkable that Jews, usually as a tiny minority, have been central to a long list of historical events. Jews were much on the mind of the Church Fathers in the fourth century during the formative years of Christian dominance in the West. Indeed, I have proposed that the powerful anti-Jewish attitudes and legislation of the fourth-century Church must be understood as a defensive reaction against Jewish economic power and enslavement of non-Jews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn1"" id=""ffn1"">[1]</a></sup> Jews who had nominally converted to Christianity but maintained their ethnic ties in marriage and commerce were the focus of the 250-year Inquisition in Spain, Portugal, and the Spanish colonies in the New World. Fundamentally, the Inquisition should be seen as a defensive reaction to the economic and political domination of these ""New Christians.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jews have also been central to all the important events of the twentieth century. Jews were a necessary component of the Bolshevik revolution that created the Soviet Union, and they remained an elite group in the Soviet Union until at least the post-World War II era. They were an important focus of National Socialism in Germany, and they have been prime movers of the post-1965 cultural and ethnic revolution in the United States, including the encouragement of massive non-white immigration to countries of European origins.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">[3]</a></sup> In the contemporary world, organized American Jewish lobbying groups and deeply committed Jews in the Bush administration and the media are behind the pro-Israel U.S. foreign policy that is leading to war against virtually the entire Arab world.</p>
<p>How can such a tiny minority have such huge effects on the history of the West? This article is the first of a three-part series on Jewish influence which seeks to answer that question. This first paper in the series provides an introduction to Jewish ethnocentrism and other background traits that influence Jewish success. The second article discusses Zionism as the quintessential example of twentieth-century Jewish ethnocentrism and as an example of a highly influential Jewish intellectualpolitical movement. A broader aim will be to discuss a generalization about Jewish history: that in the long run the more extreme elements of the Jewish community win out and determine the direction of the entire group. As Jonathan Sacks points out, it is the committed core—made up now especially of highly influential and vigorous Jewish activist organizations in the United States and hypernationalist elements in Israel—that determines the future direction of the community.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn4"" id=""ffn4"">[4]</a></sup> The third and final article will discuss neoconservatism as a Jewish intellectual and political movement. Although I touched on neoconservatism in my trilogy on Jews,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn5"" id=""ffn5"">[5]</a></sup> the present influence of this movement on U.S. foreign policy necessitates a much fuller treatment.</p>
<p>The four background traits—discussed in more detail below—are ethnocentrism, intelligence, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness. These traits are seen as underlying Jewish success in producing focused, effective groups able to influence the political process and the wider culture. In the modern world, Jewish influence on politics and culture is channeled through the media and through elite academic institutions into an almost bewildering array of areas—far too many to consider here.</p>
<h2>I. Jews Are Hyperethnocentric</h2>
<p>Elsewhere I have argued that Jewish hyperethnocentrism can be traced back to their Middle Eastern origins.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn6"" id=""ffn6"">[6]</a></sup> Traditional Jewish culture has a number of features identifying Jews with the ancestral cultures of the area. The most important of these is that Jews and other Middle Eastern cultures evolved under circumstances that favored large groups dominated by males.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn7"" id=""ffn7"">[7]</a></sup> These groups were basically extended families with high levels of endogamy (i.e., marriage within the kinship group) and consanguineous marriage (i.e., marriage to blood relatives), including the uncle-niece marriage sanctioned in the Old Testament. These features are exactly the opposite of Western European tendencies (see Table 1).<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn8"" id=""ffn8"">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Whereas Western societies tend toward individualism, the basic Jewish cultural form is collectivism, in which there is a strong sense of group identity and group boundaries. Middle Eastern societies are characterized by anthropologists as ""segmentary societies"" organized into relatively impermeable, kinship-based groups.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn9"" id=""ffn9"">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Group boundaries are often reinforced through external markers such as hair style or clothing, as Jews have often done throughout their history. Different groups settle in different areas where they retain their homogeneity alongside other homogeneous groups, as illustrated by the following account from Carleton Coon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There the ideal was to emphasize not the uniformity of the citizens of a country as a whole but a uniformity within each special segment, and the greatest possible contrast between segments. The members of each ethnic unit feel the need to identify themselves by some configuration of symbols. If by virtue of their history they possess some racial peculiarity, this they will enhance by special haircuts and the like; in any case they will wear distinctive garments and behave in a distinctive fashion.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn10"" id=""ffn10"">[10]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These societies are by no means blissful paradises of multiculturalism. Between-group conflict often lurks just beneath the surface. For example, in nineteenth-century Turkey, Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived in a sort of superficial harmony, and even inhabited the same areas, ""but the slightest spark sufficed to ignite the fuse.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn11"" id=""ffn11"">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jews are at the extreme of this Middle Eastern tendency toward hypercollectivism and hyperethnocentrism. I give many examples of Jewish hyperethnocentrism in my trilogy on Judaism and have suggested in several places that Jewish hyperethnocentrism is biologically based.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn12"" id=""ffn12"">[12]</a></sup> Middle Eastern ethnocentrism and fanaticism has struck a good many people as extreme, including William Hamilton, perhaps the most important evolutionary biologist of the twentieth century. Hamilton writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sure I am not the first to have wondered what it is about that part of the world that feeds such diverse and intense senses of rectitude as has created three of the worlds' most persuasive and yet most divisive and mutually incompatible religions. It is hard to discern the root in the place where I usually look for roots of our strong emotions, the part deepest in us, our biology and evolution.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn13"" id=""ffn13"">[13]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referring to my first two books on Judaism, Hamilton then notes that ""even a recent treatise on this subject, much as I agree with its general theme, seems to me hardly to reach to this point of the discussion."" If I failed to go far enough in describing or analyzing Jewish ethnocentrism, it is perhaps because the subject seems almost mind-bogglingly deep, with psychological ramifications everywhere. As a pan-humanist, Hamilton was acutely aware of the ramifications of human ethnocentrism and especially of the Jewish variety. Likening Judaism to the creation of a new human species, Hamilton noted that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from a humanist point of view, were those ""species"" the Martian thought to see in the towns and villages a millennium or so ago a good thing? Should we have let their crystals grow; do we retrospectively approve them? As by growth in numbers by land annexation, by the heroizing of a recent mass murderer of Arabs [i.e., Baruch Goldstein, who murdered 29 Arabs, including children, at the Patriarch's Cave in Hebron in 1994], and by the honorific burial accorded to a publishing magnate (Robert Maxwell), who had enriched Israel partly by his swindling of his employees, most of them certainly not Jews, some Israelis seem to favour a ""racewise"" and unrestrained competi-tion, just as did the ancient Israelites and Nazi Germans. In proportion to the size of the country and the degree to which the eyes of the world are watching, the acts themselves that betray this trend of reversion from panhumanism may seem small as yet, but the spirit behind them, to this observer, seems virtually identical to trends that have long predated them both in humans and animals.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn14"" id=""ffn14"">[14]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good start for thinking about Jewish ethnocentrism is the work of Israel Shahak, most notably his co-authored <em>Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel</em>.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn15"" id=""ffn15"">[15]</a></sup> Present-day fundamentalists attempt to re-create the life of Jewish communities before the Enlightenment (i.e., prior to about 1750). During this period the great majority of Jews believed in Cabbala-Jewish mysticism. Influential Jewish scholars like Gershom Scholem ignored the obvious racialist, exclusivist material in the Cabbala by using words like ""men,"" ""human beings,"" and ""cosmic"" to suggest the Cabbala has a universalist message. The actual text says salvation is only for Jews, while non-Jews have ""Satanic souls.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn16"" id=""ffn16"">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ethnocentrism apparent in such statements was not only the norm in traditional Jewish society, but remains a powerful current of contemporary Jewish fundamentalism, with important implications for Israeli politics. For example, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, describing the difference between Jews and non-Jews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not have a case of profound change in which a person is merely on a superior level. Rather we have a case of...a totally different species.... The body of a Jewish person is of a totally different quality from the body of [members] of all nations of the world.... The difference of the inner quality [of the body]…is so great that the bodies would be considered as completely different species. This is the reason why the Talmud states that there is an halachic difference in attitude about the bodies of non-Jews [as opposed to the bodies of Jews]: ""their bodies are in vain"".... An even greater difference exists in regard to the soul. Two contrary types of soul exist, anon-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while the Jewish soul stems from holiness.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn17"" id=""ffn17"">[17]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This claim of Jewish uniqueness echoes Holocaust activist Elie Wiesel's claim that ""everything about us is different."" Jews are ""ontologically"" exceptional.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn18"" id=""ffn18"">[18]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Gush Emunim and other Jewish fundamentalist sects described by Shahak and Mezvinsky are thus part of a long mainstream Jewish tradition which considers Jews and non-Jews completely different species, with Jews absolutely superior to non-Jews and subject to a radically different moral code. Moral universalism is thus antithetical to the Jewish tradition, in which the survival and interests of the Jewish people are the most important ethical goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many Jews, especially religious Jews today in Israel and their supporters abroad, continue to adhere to traditional Jewish ethics that other Jews would like to ignore or explain away. For example, Rabbi Yitzhak Ginzburg of Joseph's Tomb in Nablus/Shechem, after several of his students were remanded on suspicion of murdering a teenage Arab girl: ""Jewish blood is not the same as the blood of a goy."" Rabbi Ido Elba: ""According to the Torah, we are in a situation of pikuah nefesh (saving a life) in time of war, and in such a situation one may kill any Gentile."" Rabbi Yisrael Ariel writes in 1982 that ""Beirut is part of the Land of Israel. [This is a reference to the boundaries of Israel as stated in the Covenant between God and Abraham in Genesis 15: 18-20 and Joshua 1: 3-4] ... our leaders should have entered Lebanon and Beirut without hesitation, and killed every single one of them. Not a memory should have remained."" It is usually yeshiva students who chant ""Death to the Arabs"" on CNN. The stealing and corruption by religious leaders that has recently been documented in trials in Israel and abroad continues to raise the question of the relationship between Judaism and ethics.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn19"" id=""ffn19"">[19]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moral particularism in its most aggressive form can be seen among the ultranationalists, such as the Gush Emunim, who hold that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jews are not, and cannot be a normal people. The eternal uniqueness of the Jews is the result of the Covenant made between God and the Jewish people at Mount Sinai …. The implication is that the transcendent imperatives for Jews effectively nullify moral laws that bind the behavior of normal nations. Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, one of Gush Emunim's most prolific ideologues, argues that the divine commandments to the Jewish people ""transcend the human notions of national rights.” He explains that while God requires other nations to abide by abstract codes of justice and righteousness, such laws do not apply to Jews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn20"" id=""ffn20"">[20]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As argued in the second paper in this series, it is the most extreme elements within the Jewish community that ultimately give direction to the community as a whole. These fundamentalist and ultranationalist groups are not tiny fringe groups, mere relics of traditional Jewish culture. They are widely respected by the Israeli public and by many Jews in the Diaspora. They have a great deal of influence on the Israeli government, especially the Likud governments and the recent government of national unity headed by Ariel Sharon. The members of Gush Emunim constitute a significant percentage of the elite units of the Israeli army, and, as expected on the hypothesis that they are extremely ethnocentric, they are much more willing to treat the Palestinians in a savage and brutal manner than are other Israeli soldiers. All together, the religious parties represent about 25% of the Israeli electorate<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn21"" id=""ffn21"">[21]</a></sup>—a percentage that is sure to increase because of the high fertility of religious Jews and because intensified troubles with the Palestinians tend to make other Israelis more sympathetic to their cause. Given the fractionated state of Israeli politics and the increasing numbers of the religious groups, it is unlikely that future governments can be formed without their participation. Peace in the Middle East therefore appears unlikely absent the complete capitulation or expulsion of the Palestinians.</p>
<p>A good discussion of Jewish moral particularism can be found in a recent article in <em>Tikkun</em>—probably the only remaining liberal Jewish publication. Kim Chernin wonders why so many Jews ""have trouble being critical of Israel.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn22"" id=""ffn22"">[22]</a></sup> She finds several obstacles to criticism of Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A conviction that Jews are always in danger, always have been, and therefore are in danger now.</li>
<p><em>Which leads to:</em></p>
<li>The insistence that a criticism is an attack and will lead to our destruction.</li>
<p><em>Which is rooted in:</em></p>
<li>The supposition that any negativity towards Jews (or Israel) is a sign of anti-Semitism and will (again, inevitably) lead to our destruction</li>
<p></p>
<li>An even more hidden belief that a sufficient amount of suffering confers the right to violence</li>
<p></p>
<li>The conviction that our beliefs, our ideology (or theology), matter more than the lives of other human beings.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Chernin presents the Jewish psychology of moral particularism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We keep a watchful eye out, we read the signs, we detect innuendo, we summon evidence, we become, as we imagine it, the ever-vigilant guardians of our people's survival. Endangered as we imagine ourselves to be; endangered as we insist we are, any negativity, criticism, or reproach, even from one of our own, takes on exaggerated dimensions; we come to perceive such criticism as a life-threatening attack.</p>
<p>The path to fear is clear. But our proclivity for this perception is itself one of our unrecognized dangers. Bit by bit, as we gather evidence to establish our perilous position in the world, we are brought to a selective perception of that world. With our attention focused on ourselves as the endangered species, it seems to follow that we ourselves can do no harm... .</p>
<p>When I lived in Israel I practiced selective perception. I was elated by our little kibbutz on the Lebanese border until I recognized that we were living on land that had belonged to our Arab neighbors. When I didn't ask how we had come to acquire that land, I practiced blindness... .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The profound depths of Jewish ethnocentrism are intimately tied up with a sense of historical persecution. Jewish memory is a memory of persecution and impending doom, a memory that justifies any response because ultimately it is Jewish survival that is at stake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fixed certainty of impending Jewish destruction. Wherever we look, we see nothing but its confirmation.... I was walking across the beautiful square in Nuremburg [sic] a couple of years ago and stopped to read a public sign. It told this story: During the Middle Ages, the town governing body, wishing to clear space for a square, burned out, burned down, and burned up the Jews who had formerly filled up the space. End of story. After that, I felt very uneasy walking through the square and I eventually stopped doing it.</p>
<p>I felt endangered, of course, a woman going about through Germany wearing a star of David. But more than that, I experienced a conspicuous and dreadful self-reproach at being so alive, so happily on vacation, now that I had come to think about the murder of my people hundreds of years before. After reading that plaque I stopped enjoying myself and began to look for other signs and traces of the mistreatment of the former Jewish community. If I had stayed longer in Nuremburg [sic], if I had gone further in this direction, I might soon have come to believe that I, personally, and my people, currently, were threatened by the contemporary Germans eating ice cream in an outdoor cafe in the square. How much more potent this tendency for alarm must be in the Middle East, in the middle of a war zone!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the powerful sense of history here. Jews have a very long historical memory. Events that happened centuries ago color their current perceptions.</p>
<p>This powerful sense of group endangerment and historical grievance is associated with a hyperbolic style of Jewish thought that runs repeatedly through Jewish rhetoric. Chernin's comment that ""any negativity, criticism, or reproach, even from one of our own, takes on exaggerated dimensions"" is particularly important. In the Jewish mind, all criticism must be suppressed because not to do so would be to risk another Holocaust: ""There is no such thing as overreaction to an anti-Semitic incident, no such thing as exaggerating the omnipresent danger. Anyone who scoffed at the idea that there were dangerous portents in American society hadn't learned ‘the lesson of the Holocaust.’”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn23"" id=""ffn23"">[23]</a></sup> Norman Podhoretz, editor of <em>Commentary</em>, a premier neoconservative journal published by the American Jewish Committee, provides an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[M]y own view is that what had befallen the Jews of Europe inculcated a subliminal lesson.... The lesson was that anti-Semitism, even the relatively harmless genteel variety that enforced quotas against Jewish students or kept their parents from joining fashionable clubs or getting jobs in prestigious Wall Street law firms, could end in mass murder.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn24"" id=""ffn24"">[24]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a ""slippery slope"" argument with a vengeance. The schema is as follows: Criticism of Jews indicates dislike of Jews; this leads to hostility toward Jews, which leads to Hitler and eventually to mass murder. Therefore all criticism of Jews must be suppressed. With this sort of logic, it is easy to dismiss arguments about Palestinian rights on the West Bank and Gaza because ""the survival of Israel"" is at stake. Consider, for example, the following advertisement distributed by neoconservative publicist David Horowitz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Middle East struggle is not about right versus right. It is about a fifty-year effort by the Arabs to destroy the Jewish state, and the refusal of the Arab states in general and the Palestinian Arabs in particular to accept Israel's existence.... The Middle East conflict is not about Israel's occupation of the territories; it is about the refusal of the Arabs to make peace with Israel, which is an expression of their desire to destroy the Jewish state.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn25"" id=""ffn25"">[25]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>""Survival of Israel"" arguments thus trump concerns about allocation of scarce resources like water, the seizure of Palestinian land, collective punishment, torture, and the complete degradation of Palestinian communities into isolated, military-occupied, Bantustan-type enclaves. The logic implies that critics of Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza also favor the destruction of Israel and hence the mass murder of millions of Jews.</p>
<p>Similarly, during the debate over selling military hardware to Saudi Arabia in the Carter administration, ""the Israeli lobby pulled out all the stops,"" including circulating books to Congress based on the TV series <em>The Holocaust</em>. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the main Jewish lobbying group in Congress, included a note stating, ""This chilling account of the extermination of six million Jews underscores Israel's concerns during the current negotiations for security without reliance on outside guarantees.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn26"" id=""ffn26"">[26]</a></sup> In other words, selling AWACS reconnaissance planes to Saudi Arabia, a backward kingdom with little military capability, is tantamount to collusion in the extermination of millions of Jews.</p>
<p>Jewish thinking about immigration into the U.S. shows the same logic. Lawrence Aus-ter, a Jewish conservative, describes the logic as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The liberal notion that ""all bigotry is indivisible"" [advocated by Norman Podhoretz] implies that all manifestations of ingroup/outgroup feeling are essentially the same— and equally <em>wrong</em>. It denies the obvious fact that some outgroups are more different from the ingroup, and hence <em>less</em> assimilable, and hence <em>more</em> legitimately excluded, than other outgroups. It means, for example, that wanting to exclude Muslim immigrants from America is as blameworthy as wanting to exclude Catholics or Jews.</p>
<p>Now when Jews put together the idea that ""all social prejudice and exclusion leads potentially to Auschwitz"" with the idea that ""all bigotry is indivisible,"" they must reach the conclusion that <em>any</em> exclusion of <em>any</em> group, no matter how alien it may be to the host society, is a potential Auschwitz.</p>
<p>So there it is. We have identified the core Jewish conviction that makes Jews keep pushing relentlessly for mass immigration, even the mass immigration of their deadliest enemies. In the thought-process of Jews, to keep Jew-hating Muslims out of America would be tantamount to preparing the way to another Jewish Holocaust.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn27"" id=""ffn27"">[27]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that any sort of exclusionary thinking on the part of Americans—and especially European Americans as a majority group—leads inexorably to a Holocaust for Jews is not the only reason why Jewish organizations still favor mass immigration. I have identified two others as well: The belief that greater diversity makes Jews safer and an intense sense of historical grievance against the traditional peoples and culture of the United States and Europe.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn28"" id=""ffn28"">[28]</a></sup> These two sentiments also illustrate Jewish moral particularism because they fail to consider the ethnic interests of other peoples in thinking about immigration policy. Recently the ""diversity-as-safety"" argument was made by Leonard S. Glickman, president and CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish group that has advocated open immigration to the United States for over a century. Glickman stated, ""The more diverse American society is the safer [Jews] are.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn29"" id=""ffn29"">[29]</a></sup> At the present time, the HIAS is deeply involved in recruiting refugees from Africa to emigrate to the U.S.</p>
<p>The diversity as safety argument and its linkage to historical grievances against European civilization is implicit in a recent statement of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) in response to former French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's argument that Muslim Turkey has no place in the European Union:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ironically, in the fifteenth century, when European monarchs expelled the Jews, it was Moslem Turkey that provided them a welcome.... During the Holocaust, when Europe was slaughtering its Jews, it was Turkish consuls who extended protection to fugitives from Vichy France and other Nazi allies.... Today's European neo-Nazis and skinheads focus upon Turkish victims while, Mr. President, you are reported to be considering the Pope's plea that your Convention emphasize Europe's Christian heritage. [The Center suggested that Giscard's new Constitution] underline the pluralism of a multi-faith and multi-ethnic Europe, in which the participation of Moslem Turkey might bolster the continent's Moslem communities—and, indeed, Turkey itself—against the menaces of extremism, hate and fundamentalism. A European Turkey can only be beneficial for stability in Europe and the Middle East.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn30"" id=""ffn30"">[30]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we see Jewish moral particularism combined with a profound sense of historical grievance—hatred by any other name—against European civilization and a desire for the end of Europe as a Christian civilization with its traditional ethnic base. According to the SWC, the menaces of ""extremism, hate and fundamentalism""—prototypically against Jews—can only be repaired by jettisoning the traditional cultural and ethnic basis of European civilization. Events that happened five hundred years ago are still fresh in the minds of Jewish activists—a phenomenon that should give pause to everyone in an age when Israel has control of nuclear weapons and long-range delivery systems.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn31"" id=""ffn31"">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, a recent article on Assyrians in the U.S. shows that many Jews have not forgiven or forgotten events of 2,700 years ago, when the Northern Israelite kingdom was forcibly relocated to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh: ""Some Assyrians say Jews are one group of people who seem to be more familiar with them. But because the Hebrew Bible describes Assyrians as cruel and ruthless conquerors, people such as the Rev. William Nissan say he is invariably challenged by Jewish rabbis and scholars about the misdeeds of his ancestors.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn32"" id=""ffn32"">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The SWC inveighs against hate but fails to confront the issue of hatred as a normative aspect of Judaism. Jewish hatred toward non-Jews emerges as a consistent theme throughout the ages, beginning in the ancient world.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn33"" id=""ffn33"">[33]</a></sup> The Roman historian Tacitus noted that ""Among themselves they are inflexibly honest and ever ready to show compassion, though they regard the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn34"" id=""ffn34"">[34]</a></sup> The eighteenth-century English historian Edward Gibbon was struck by the fanatical hatred of Jews in the ancient world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives; and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but of human kind.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn35"" id=""ffn35"">[35]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nineteenth-century Spanish historian José Amador de los Rios wrote of the Spanish Jews who assisted the Muslim conquest of Spain that ""without any love for the soil where they lived, without any of those affections that ennoble a people, and finally without sentiments of generosity, they aspired only to feed their avarice and to accomplish the ruin of the Goths; taking the opportunity to manifest their rancor, and boasting of the hatreds that they had hoarded up so many centuries.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn36"" id=""ffn36"">[36]</a></sup> In 1913, economist Werner Sombart, in his classic <em>Jews and Modern Capitalism</em>, summarized Judaism as ""a group by themselves and therefore separate and apart—this from the earliest antiquity. All nations were struck by their hatred of others.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn37"" id=""ffn37"">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>A recent article by Meir Y. Soloveichik, aptly titled ""The virtue of hate,” amplifies this theme of normative Jewish fanatical hatred.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn38"" id=""ffn38"">[38]</a></sup> “Judaism believes that while forgiveness is often a virtue, hate can be virtuous when one is dealing with the frightfully wicked. Rather than forgive, we can wish ill; rather than hope for repentance, we can instead hope that our enemies experience the wrath of God.” Soloveichik notes that the Old Testament is replete with descriptions of horribly violent deaths inflicted on the enemies of the Israelites—the desire not only for revenge but for revenge in the bloodiest, most degrading manner imaginable: ""The Hebrew prophets not only hated their enemies, but rather reveled in their suffering, finding in it a fitting justice.” In the Book of Esther, after the Jews kill the ten sons of Haman, their persecutor, Esther asks that they be hanged on a gallows.</p>
<p>This normative fanatical hatred in Judaism can be seen by the common use among Orthodox Jews of the phrase <em>yemach shemo</em>, meaning, <em>may his name be erased</em>. This phrase is used ""whenever a great enemy of the Jewish nation, of the past or present, is mentioned. For instance, one might very well say casually, in the course of conversation, ‘Thank God, my grandparents left Germany before Hitler, yemach shemo, came to power.' Or: ‘My parents were murdered by the Nazis, yemach shemam.’”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn39"" id=""ffn39"">[39]</a></sup> Again we see that the powerful consciousness of past suffering leads to present-day intense hatred:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another danger inherent in hate is that we may misdirect our odium at institutions in the present because of their past misdeeds. For instance, some of my coreligionists reserve special abhorrence for anything German, even though Germany is currently one of the most pro-Israel countries in Europe. Similarly, after centuries of suffering, many Jews have, in my own experience, continued to despise religious Christians, even though it is secularists and Islamists who threaten them today, and Christians should really be seen as their natural allies. Many Jewish intellectuals and others of influence still take every assertion of the truth of Christianity as an anti-Semitic attack. After the Catholic Church beatified Edith Stein, a Jewish convert to Christianity, some prominent Jews asserted that the Church was attempting to cover up its role in causing the Holocaust. And then there is the historian Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, who essentially has asserted that any attempt by the Catholic Church to maintain that Christianity is the one true faith marks a continuation of the crimes of the Church in the past. Burning hatred, once kindled, is difficult to extinguish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soloveichik could also have included Jewish hatred toward the traditional peoples and culture of the United States. This hatred stems from Jewish memory of the immigration law of 1924, which is seen as having resulted in a greater number of Jews dying in the Holocaust because it restricted Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. Jews are also acutely aware of widespread anti-Jewish attitudes in the U.S. prior to World War II. The hatred continues despite the virtual disappearance of anti-Jewish attitudes in the U.S. after World War II and despite the powerful ties between the United States and Israel.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn40"" id=""ffn40"">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Given the transparently faulty logic and obvious self-interest involved in arguments made by Jewish activists, it is not unreasonable to suppose that Jews are often engaged in self-deception. In fact, self-deception is a very important component of Jewish moral particularism. I wrote an entire chapter on Jewish self-deception in <em>Separation and Its Discontents</em>,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn41"" id=""ffn41"">[41]</a></sup> but it was nowhere near enough. Again, Kim Chernin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our sense of victimization as a people works in a dangerous and seditious way against our capacity to know, to recognize, to name and to remember. Since we have adopted ourselves as victims we cannot correctly read our own history let alone our present circumstances. Even where the story of our violence is set down in a sacred text that we pore over again and again, we cannot see it. Our self-election as the people most likely to be victimized obscures rather than clarifies our own tradition.</p>
<p>I can't count the number of times I read the story of Joshua as a tale of our people coming into their rightful possession of their promised land without stopping to say to myself, ""but this is a history of rape, plunder, slaughter, invasion and destruction of other peoples.” As such, it bears an uncomfortably close resemblance to the behavior of Israeli settlers and the Israeli army of today, a behavior we also cannot see for what it is.</p>
<p>We are tracing the serpentine path of our own psychology. We find it organized around a persuasion of victimization, which leads to a sense of entitlement to enact violence, which brings about an inevitable distortion in the way we perceive both our Jewish identity and the world, and involves us finally in a tricky relationship to language.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn42"" id=""ffn42"">[42]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Political columnist Joe Sobran—who has suffered professionally for expressing his opinions about Israel—exposes the moral particularism of Norman Podhoretz, one of the chorus of influential Jewish voices who advocate restructuring the entire Middle East in the interests of Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Podhoretz has <em>unconsciously</em> exposed the Manichaean fantasy world of so many of those who are now calling for war with Iraq. The United States and Israel are ""good""; the Arab-Muslim states are ""evil""; and those opposed to this war represent ""moral relativism,"" ostensibly neutral but virtually on the side of ""evil.""</p>
<p>This is simply deranged. The ability to see evil only in one's enemies isn't ""moral clarity."" It's the essence of fanaticism. We are now being counseled to fight one kind of fanaticism with another.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn43"" id=""ffn43"">[43]</a></sup> [My emphasis]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Sobran notes, the moral particularism is unconscious—an example of self-deception. The world is cut up into two parts, the good and the evil—ingroup-outgroup—as it has been, for Jews, for well over two thousand years. Recently Jared Taylor and David Horowitz got into a discussion which touched on Jewish issues. Taylor writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Horowitz deplores the idea that ""we are all prisoners of identity politics,"" implying that race and ethnicity are trivial matters we must work to overcome. But if that is so, why does the home page of FrontPageMag carry a perpetual appeal for contributions to ""David's Defense of Israel Campaign""? Why Israel rather than, say, Kurdistan or Tibet or Euskadi or Chechnya? Because Mr. Horowitz is Jewish. His commitment to Israelis an expression of precisely the kind of particularist identity he would deny to me and to other racially-conscious whites. He passionately supports a self-consciously Jewish state but calls it ""surrendering to the multicultural miasma"" when I work to return to a self-consciously white America. He supports an explicitly ethnic identity for Israel but says American must not be allowed to have one....</p>
<p>If he supports a Jewish Israel, he should support a white America.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn44"" id=""ffn44"">[44]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taylor is suggesting that Horowitz is self-deceived or inconsistent. It is interesting that Horowitz was acutely aware of his own parents' self-deception. Horowitz's description of his parents shows the strong ethnocentrism that lurked beneath the noisy universalism of Jewish communists in mid-twentieth century America. In his book, <em>Radical Son</em>, Horowitz describes the world of his parents who had joined a ""shul"" (i.e., a synagogue) run by the Communist Party in which Jewish holidays were given a political interpretation. Psychologically these people might as well have been in eighteenth-century Poland, but they were completely unaware of any Jewish identity. Horowitz writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What my parents had done in joining the Communist Party and moving to Sunnyside was to return to the ghetto. There was the same shared private language, the same hermetically sealed universe, the same dual posturing revealing one face to the outer world and another to the tribe. More importantly, there was the same conviction of being marked for persecution and specially ordained, the sense of moral superiority toward the stronger and more numerous goyim outside. And there was the same fear of expulsion for heretical thoughts, which was the fear that riveted the chosen to the faith.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn45"" id=""ffn45"">[45]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jews recreate Jewish social structure wherever they are, even when they are completely unaware they are doing so. When asked about their Jewish commitments, these communists denied having any.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn46"" id=""ffn46"">[46]</a></sup> Nor were they consciously aware of having chosen ethnically Jewish spouses, although they all married other Jews. This denial has been useful for Jewish organizations and Jewish intellectual apologists attempting to de-emphasize the role of Jews on the radical left in the twentieth century. For example, a common tactic of the ADL beginning in the Red Scare era of the 1920s right up through the Cold War era was to claim that Jewish radicals were no longer Jews because they had no Jewish religious commitments.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn47"" id=""ffn47"">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Non-Jews run the risk of failing to truly understand how powerful these Jewish traits of moral particularism and self-deception really are. When confronted with his own rabid support for Israel, Horowitz simply denies that ethnicity has much to do with it; he supports Israel as a matter of principle—his commitment to universalist moral principles—and he highlights the relationship between Israel and the West: ""Israel is under attack by the same enemy that has attacked the United States. Israel is the point of origin for the culture of the West.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn48"" id=""ffn48"">[48]</a></sup> This ignores the reality that, as noted by the 9/11 Commission Report, Israel's treatment of the Palestinians is a major part of the reason why the United States was attacked and is hated throughout the Arab world (<strong>see p. 125, endnote 241</strong>). It also ignores the fact that Western culture and its strong strain of individualism are the antithesis of Judaism, and that Israel's Western veneer overlays the deep structure of Israel as an apartheid, ethnically based state.</p>
<p>It's difficult to argue with people who cannot see or at least won't acknowledge the depths of their own ethnic commitments and continue to act in ways that compromise the ethnic interests of others. People like Horowitz (and his parents) can't see their ethnic commitments even when they are obvious to everyone else. One could perhaps say the same of Charles Krauthammer, William Safire, William Kristol, Norman Podhoretz, and the legion of prominent Jews who collectively dominate the perception of Israel presented by the U.S. media. Not surprisingly, Horowitz pictures the U.S. as a set of universal principles, with no ethnic content. This idea originated with Jewish intellectuals, particularly Horace Kallen, almost a century ago at a time when there was a strong conception that the United States was a European civilization whose characteristics were racially/ethnically based.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn49"" id=""ffn49"">[49]</a></sup> As we all know, this world and its intellectual infrastructure have vanished, and I have tried to show that the prime force opposing a European racial/ethnic conception of the U.S. was a set of Jewish intellectual and political movements that collectively pathologized any sense of European ethnicity or European ethnic interests.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn50"" id=""ffn50"">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Given that extreme ethnocentrism continues to pervade all segments of the organized Jewish community, the advocacy of the de-ethnicization of Europeans—a common sentiment in the movements I discuss in <em>Culture of Critique</em> (<em>CofC</em>)—is best seen as a strategic move against peoples regarded as historical enemies. In Chapter 8 of <em>CofC</em>, I call attention to a long list of similar double standards, especially with regard to the policies pursued by Israel versus the policies Jewish organizations have pursued in the U.S. These policies include church-state separation, attitudes toward multiculturalism, and immigration policies favoring the dominant ethnic group. This double standard is fairly pervasive. As noted throughout <em>CofC</em>, Jewish advocates addressing Western audiences have promoted policies that satisfy Jewish (particularist) interests in terms of the morally universalist language that is a central feature of Western moral and intellectual discourse; obviously David Horowitz's rationalization of his commitment to Israel is a prime example of this.</p>
<p>A principal theme of <em>CofC</em> is that Jewish organizations played a decisive role in opposing the idea that the United States ought to be a European nation. Nevertheless, these organizations have been strong supporters of Israel as a nation of the Jewish people. Consider, for example, a press release of May 28, 1999, by the ADL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today lauded the passage of sweeping changes in Germany's immigration law, saying the easing of the nation's once rigorous naturalization requirements ""will provide a climate for diversity and acceptance. It is encouraging to see pluralism taking root in a society that, despite its strong democracy, had for decades maintained an unyielding policy of citizenship by blood or descent only,"" said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director. ""The easing of immigration requirements is especially significant in light of Germany's history of the Holocaust and persecution of Jews and other minority groups. The new law will provide a climate for diversity and acceptance in a nation with an onerous legacy of xenophobia, where the concept of ‘us versus them' will be replaced by a principle of citizenship for all.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn51"" id=""ffn51"">[51]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no mention of analogous laws in place in Israel restricting immigration to Jews, or of the long-standing policy of rejecting the possibility of repatriation for Palestinian refugees wishing to return to Israel or the occupied territories. The prospective change in the ""us versus them"" attitude alleged to be characteristic of Germany is applauded, while the ""us versus them"" attitude characteristic of Israel and Jewish culture throughout history is unmentioned. Recently, the Israeli Ministry of Interior ruled that new immigrants who have converted to Judaism will no longer be able to bring non-Jewish family members into the country. The decision is expected to cut by half the number of eligible immigrants to Israel. Nevertheless, Jewish organizations continue to be strong proponents of multiethnic immigration to the United States while maintaining unquestioning support for Israel. This pervasive double standard was noticed by writer Vincent Sheean in his observations of Zionists in Palestine in 1930: ""how idealism goes hand in hand with the most terrific cynicism; ... how they are Fascists in their own affairs, with regard to Palestine, and internationalists in everything else.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn52"" id=""ffn52"">[52]</a></sup> The right hand does not know what the left is doing—self-deception writ large.</p>
<p>Jewish ethnocentrism is well founded in the sense that scientific studies supporting the genetic cohesiveness of Jewish groups continue to appear. Most notable of the recent studies is that of Michael Hammer and colleagues.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn53"" id=""ffn53"">[53]</a></sup> Based on Y-chromosome data, Hammer et al. conclude that 1 in 200 matings within Jewish communities were with non-Jews over a 2000-year period.</p>
<p>Because of their intense ethnocentrism, Jews tend to have great rapport with each oth-er—an important ingredient in producing effective groups. One way to understand this powerful attraction for fellow ethnic group members is J. Philippe Rushton's Genetic Similarity Theory.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn54"" id=""ffn54"">[54]</a></sup> According to GST, people are attracted to others who are genetically similar to themselves. One of the basic ideas of evolutionary biology is that people are expected to help relatives because they share similar genes. When a father helps a child or an uncle helps a nephew, he is really also helping himself because of their close genetic relationship. (Parents share half their genes with their children; uncles share one-fourth of their genes with nieces and nephews.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn55"" id=""ffn55"">[55]</a></sup>) GST extends this concept to non-relatives by arguing that people benefit when they favor others who are genetically similar to them even if they are not relatives.</p>
<p>GST has some important implications for understanding cooperation and cohesiveness among Jews. It predicts that people will be friendlier to other people who are genetically more similar to themselves. In the case of Jews and non-Jews, it predicts that Jews would be more likely to make friends and alliances with other Jews, and that there would be high levels of rapport and psychological satisfaction within these relationships.</p>
<p>GST explains the extraordinary rapport and cohesiveness among Jews. Since the vast majority of Jews are closely related genetically, GST predicts that they will be very attracted to other Jews and may even be able to recognize them in the absence of distinctive clothing and hair styles. There is anecdotal evidence for this statement. Theologian Eugene Borowitz writes that Jews seek each other out in social situations and feel ""far more at home"" after they have discovered who is Jewish.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn56"" id=""ffn56"">[56]</a></sup> “Most Jews claim to be equipped with an interpersonal friend-or-foe sensing device that enables them to detect the presence of another Jew, despite heavy camouflage."" Another Jewish writer comments on the incredible sense of oneness he has with other Jews and his ability to recognize other Jews in public places, a talent some Jews call ""J-dar.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn57"" id=""ffn57"">[57]</a></sup> While dining with his non-Jewish fiancée, he is immediately recognized as Jewish by some other Jews, and there is an immediate ""bond of brotherhood"" between them that excludes his non-Jewish companion.</p>
<p>Robert Reich, Clinton administration Secretary of Labor, wrote that in his first face-to-face meeting with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have never met before, but I instantly know him. One look, one phrase, and I know where he grew up, how he grew up, where he got his drive and his sense of humor. He is New York. He is Jewish. He looks like my uncle Louis, his voice is my uncle Sam. I feel we've been together at countless weddings, bar mitzvahs, and funerals. I know his genetic structure. I'm certain that within the last five hundred years—perhaps even more recently—we shared the same ancestor.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn58"" id=""ffn58"">[58]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reich is almost certainly correct: He and Greenspan do indeed have a recent common ancestor, and this genetic affinity causes them to have an almost supernatural attraction to each other. Or consider Sigmund Freud, who wrote that he found ""the attraction of Judaism and of Jews so irresistible, many dark emotional powers, all the mightier the less they let themselves be grasped in words, as well as the clear consciousness of inner identity, the secrecy of the same mental construction.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn59"" id=""ffn59"">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>Any discussion of Judaism has to start and probably end with this incredibly strong bond that Jews have among each other—a bond that is created by their close genetic relationship and by the intensification of the psychological mechanisms underlying group cohesion. This powerful rapport among Jews translates into a heightened ability to cooperate in highly focused groups.</p>
<p>To conclude this section: In general, the contemporary organized Jewish community is characterized by high levels of Jewish identification and ethnocentrism. Jewish activist organizations like the ADL, the American Jewish Committee, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and the neoconservative think tanks are not creations of the fundamentalist and Orthodox, but represent the broad Jewish community, including non-religious Jews and Reform Jews. In general, the more actively people are involved in the Jewish community, the more committed they are to preventing intermarriage and retaining Jewish ethnic cohesion. And despite a considerable level of intermarriage among less committed Jews, the leadership of the Jewish community in the U.S. is at present not made up of the offspring of intermarried people to any significant extent.</p>
<p>Jewish ethnocentrism is ultimately simple traditional human ethnocentrism, although it is certainly among the more extreme varieties. But what is so fascinating is the cloak of intellectual support for Jewish ethnocentrism, the complexity and intellectual sophistication of the rationalizations for it—some of which are reviewed in <em>Separation and Its Discontents</em><sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn60"" id=""ffn60"">[60]</a></sup> and the rather awesome hypocrisy (or cold-blooded deception) of it, given Jewish opposition to ethnocentrism among Europeans.</p>
<h2>II. Jews Are Intelligent (and Wealthy)</h2>
<p>The vast majority of U.S. Jews are Ashkenazi Jews. This is a very intelligent group, with an average IQ of approximately 115 and verbal IQ considerably higher.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn61"" id=""ffn61"">[61]</a></sup> Since verbal IQ is the best predictor of occupational success and upward mobility in contemporary societies,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn62"" id=""ffn62"">[62]</a></sup> it is not surprising that Jews are an elite group in the United States. Frank Salter has showed that on issues of concern to the Jewish community (Israel, immigration, ethnic policy in general), Jewish groups have four times the influence of European Americans despite representing approximately 2.5% of the population.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn63"" id=""ffn63"">[63]</a></sup> Recent data indicate that Jewish per capita income in the U.S. is almost double that of non-Jews, a bigger difference than the black-white income gap.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn64"" id=""ffn64"">[64]</a></sup> Although Jews make up less than 3% of the population, they constitute more than a quarter of the people on the Forbes list of the richest four hundred Americans. Jews constitute 45% of the top forty of the <em>Forbes</em> 400 richest Americans. Fully one-third of all American multimillionaires are Jewish. The percentage of Jewish households with income greater than $50,000 is double that of non-Jews; on the other hand, the percentage of Jewish households with income less than $20,000 is half that of non-Jews. Twenty percent of professors at leading universities are Jewish, and 40% of partners in leading New York and Washington, D.C., law firms are Jewish.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn65"" id=""ffn65"">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1996, there were approximately 300 national Jewish organizations in the United States, with a combined budget estimated in the range of $6 billion—a sum greater than the gross national product of half the members of the United Nations.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn66"" id=""ffn66"">[66]</a></sup> For example, in 2001 the ADL claimed an annual budget of over $50,000,000.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn67"" id=""ffn67"">[67]</a></sup> There is also a critical mass of very wealthy Jews who are actively involved in funding Jewish causes. Irving Moskowitz funds the settler movement in Israel and pro-Israeli, neoconservative think tanks in Washington, D.C., while Charles Bronfman, Ronald Lauder, and the notorious Marc Rich fund Birthright Israel, a program that aims to increase ethnic consciousness among Jews by bringing 20,000 young Jews to Israel every year. George Soros finances liberal immigration policy throughout the Western world and also funds Noel Ignatiev and his ""Race Traitor"" website dedicated to the abolition of the white race. So far as I know, there are no major sources of funding aimed at increasing ethnic consciousness among Europeans or at promoting European ethnic interests.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn68"" id=""ffn68"">[68]</a></sup> Certainly the major sources of conservative funding in the U.S., such as the Bradley and Olin Foundations, are not aimed at this sort of thing. Indeed, the Bradley Foundation has been a major source of funding for the largely Jewish neoconservative movement and for pro-Israel think tanks such as the Center for Security Policy.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn69"" id=""ffn69"">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>Paul Findley<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn70"" id=""ffn70"">[70]</a></sup> provides numerous examples of Jews using their financial clout to support political candidates with positions that are to the liking of AIPAC and other pro-Israel activist groups in the U.S. This very large financial support for pro-Israel candidates continues into the present—the most recent examples being the campaigns to unseat Cynthia McKinney and Earl Hilliard from Congress in 2002. Because of their predominantly Jewish funding base,<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn71"" id=""ffn71"">[71]</a></sup> Democratic candidates are particularly vulnerable, but all candidates experience this pressure because Jewish support will be funneled to their opponents if there is any hint of disagreement with the pro-Israel lobby.</p>
<p>Intelligence is also important in providing access to the entire range of influential positions, from the academic world, to the media, to business, politics, and the legal profession. In <em>CofC</em> I describe several influential Jewish intellectual movements developed by networks of Jews who were motivated to advance Jewish causes and interests. These movements were the backbone of the intellectual left in the twentieth century, and their influence continues into the present. Collectively, they call into question the fundamental moral, political, and economic foundations of Western society. These movements have been advocated with great intellectual passion and moral fervor and with a very high level of theoretical sophistication. As with the neoconservative movement, discussed in the third article in this series, all of these movements had ready access to prestigious mainstream media sources, at least partly because of the high representation of Jews as owners and producers of mainstream media.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn72"" id=""ffn72"">[72]</a></sup> All of these movements were strongly represented at prestigious universities, and their work was published by prestigious mainstream academic and commercial publishers.</p>
<p>Intelligence is also evident in Jewish activism. Jewish activism is like a full court press in basketball: intense pressure from every possible angle. But in addition to the intensity, Jewish efforts are very well organized, well funded, and backed up by sophisticated, scholarly intellectual defenses. A good example is the long and ultimately successful attempt to alter U.S. immigration policy.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn73"" id=""ffn73"">[73]</a></sup> The main Jewish activist organization influencing immigration policy, the American Jewish Committee, was characterized by ""strong leadership, internal cohesion, well-funded programs, sophisticated lobbying techniques, well-chosen non-Jewish allies, and good timing.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn74"" id=""ffn74"">[74]</a></sup> The most visible Jewish activists, such as Louis Marshall, were intellectually brilliant and enormously energetic and resourceful in their crusades on behalf of immigration and other Jewish causes. When restrictionist arguments appeared in the media, the American Jewish Committee made sophisticated replies based on at least the appearance of scholarly data, and typically couched in universalist terms as benefiting the whole society. Articles favorable to immigration were published in national magazines, and letters to the editor were published in newspapers. Talented lawyers initiated legal proceedings aimed at preventing the deportation of aliens.</p>
<p>The pro-immigration lobby was also very well organized. Immigration opponents, such as Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and organizations like the Immigration Restriction League were kept under close scrutiny and pressured by lobbyists. Lobbyists in Washington also kept a daily scorecard of voting tendencies as immigration bills wended their way through Congress, and they engaged in intense and successful efforts to convince Presidents Taft and Wilson to veto restrictive immigration legislation. Catholic prelates were recruited to protest the effects of restrictionist legislation on immigration from Italy and Hungary. There were well-organized efforts to minimize the negative perceptions of immigration by distributing Jewish immigrants around the country and by getting Jewish aliens off public support. Highly visible and noisy mass protest meetings were organized.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn75"" id=""ffn75"">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>Intelligence and organization are also apparent in contemporary Jewish lobbying on behalf of Israel. Les Janka, a U.S. Defense Department official, noted that, ""On all kinds of foreign policy issues the American people just don't make their voices heard. Jewish groups are the exceptions. They are prepared, superbly briefed. They have their act together. It is hard for bureaucrats not to respond.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn76"" id=""ffn76"">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>Morton A. Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), is typical of the highly intelligent, competent, and dedicated Jewish activist. The ZOA website states that Klein had a distinguished career as a biostatistician in academe and in government service in the Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations. He has received accolades as one of the leading Jewish activists in the U.S., especially by media that are closely associated with Likud policies in Israel. For example, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> called the ZOA ""heroic and the most credible advocate for Israel on the American Jewish scene today” and added that we should ""snap a salute to those who were right about Oslo and Arafat all along, ...including Morton Klein who was wise, brave and unflinchingly honest.... [W]hen the history of the American Jewish struggle in these years is written, Mr. Klein will emerge as an outsized figure.” The website boasts of Klein's success ""against anti-Israel bias in textbooks, travel guides, universities, churches, and the media, as well as his work on Capitol Hill.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn77"" id=""ffn77"">[77]</a></sup> Klein has led successful efforts to block the appointment of Joe Zogby, an Arab American, to the State Department and the appointment of Strobe Talbott, Clinton nominee for Deputy Secretary of State.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn78"" id=""ffn78"">[78]</a></sup> Klein's pro-Israel articles have appeared in a wide range of mainstream and Jewish media: <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>New Republic</em>, <em>New Yorker</em>, <em>Commentary</em>, <em>Near East Report</em>, <em>Reform Judaism</em>, <em>Moment</em>, <em>Forward</em>, <em>Jerusalem Post</em>, <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, <em>Miami Herald</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>Ha'aretz</em> (Jerusalem), <em>Maariv</em> (Jerusalem), and the Israeli-Russian paper <em>Vesti</em>.</p>
<p>Klein's activism highlights the importance of access to the major media enjoyed by Jewish activists and organizations—a phenomenon that is traceable ultimately to Jewish intelligence. Jews have a very large presence in the media as owners, writers, producers, and editors—far larger than any other identifiable group.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn79"" id=""ffn79"">[79]</a></sup> In the contemporary world, this presence is especially important with respect to perceptions of Israel. Media coverage of Israel in the U.S. is dominated by a pro-Israel bias, whereas in most of the world the predominant view is that the Palestinians are a dispossessed people under siege.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn80"" id=""ffn80"">[80]</a></sup> A critical source of support for Israel is the army of professional pundits ""who can be counted upon to support Israel reflexively and without qualification.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn81"" id=""ffn81"">[81]</a></sup> Perhaps the most egregious example of pro-Israel bias resulting from Jewish media control is the Asper family, owners of CanWest, a company that controls over 33% of the English-language newspapers in Canada. CanWest inaugurated an editorial policy in which all editorials had to be approved by the main office. As the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression notes, ""the Asper family staunchly supports Israel in its conflicts with Palestinians, and coverage of the Middle East appears to be a particularly sensitive area.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn82"" id=""ffn82"">[82]</a></sup> CanWest has exercised control over the content of articles related to Israel by editing and spiking articles with pro-Palestinian or anti-Israeli views. Journalists who have failed to adopt CanWest positions have been reprimanded or dismissed.</p>
<h2>III. Jews Are Psychologically Intense</h2>
<p>I have compared Jewish activism to a full court press—relentlessly intense and covering every possible angle. There is considerable evidence that Jews are higher than average on emotional intensity.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn83"" id=""ffn83"">[83]</a></sup> Emotionally intense people are prone to intense emotional experience of both positive and negative emotions.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn84"" id=""ffn84"">[84]</a></sup> Emotionality may be thought of as a behavioral intensifier—an energizer. Individuals high on affect intensity have more complex social networks and more complex lives, including multiple and even conflicting goals. Their goals are intensely sought after.</p>
<p>In the case of Jews, this affects the tone and intensity of their efforts at activism. Among Jews there is a critical mass that is intensely committed to Jewish causes—a sort of 24/7, ""pull out all the stops"" commitment that produces instant, massive responses on Jewish issues. Jewish activism has a relentless, never-say-die quality. This intensity goes hand in hand with the ""slippery slope"" style of arguing described above: Jewish activism is an intense response because even the most trivial manifestation of anti-Jewish attitudes or behavior is seen as inevitably leading to mass murder of Jews if allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Besides its ability to direct Jewish money to its preferred candidates, a large part of AIPAC's effectiveness lies in its ability to rapidly mobilize its 60,000 members. ""In virtually every congressional district...AIPAC has a group of prominent citizens it can mobilize if an individual senator or representative needs stroking.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn85"" id=""ffn85"">[85]</a></sup> When Senator Charles Percy suggested that Israel negotiate with the PLO and be willing to trade land for peace, he was inundated with 2,200 telegrams and 4,000 letters, 95% against, and mainly from the Jewish community in Chicago.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn86"" id=""ffn86"">[86]</a></sup> The other side is seldom able to muster a response that competes with the intensity of the Jewish response. When President Eisenhower—the last president to stand up to the pro-Israel lobby—pressured Israel into withdrawing from the Sinai in 1957, almost all the mail opposed his decision. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles complained, ""It is impossible to hold the line because we get no support from the Protestant elements in the country. All we get is a battering from the Jews.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn87"" id=""ffn87"">[87]</a></sup> This pales in comparison to the avalanche of 150,000 letters to President Johnson urging support for Israel when Egypt closed the Strait of Tiran in May 1967. This was just prior to the ""Six-Day War,"" during which the U.S. provided a great deal of military assistance and actively cooperated in the cover-up of the assault on the USS <em>Liberty</em>. Jews had learned from their defeat at the hands of Eisenhower and had redoubled their lobbying efforts, creating by all accounts the most effective lobby in Washington.</p>
<p>Pressure on officials in the State and Defense departments is relentless and intense. In the words of one official, ""One has to keep in mind the constant character of this pressure. The public affairs staff of the Near East Bureau in the State Department figures it will spend about 75 percent of its time dealing with Jewish groups. Hundreds of such groups get appointments in the executive branch each year.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn88"" id=""ffn88"">[88]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Psychological intensity is also typical of Israelis. For example, the Israelis are remarkably persistent in their attempts to obtain U.S. military hardware. The following comment illustrates not only the relentless, intense pressure, but also the aggressiveness of Jewish pursuit of their interests: ""They would never take no for an answer. They never gave up. These emissaries of a foreign government always had a shopping list of wanted military items, some of them high technology that no other nation possessed, some of it secret devices that gave the United States an edge over any adversary.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn89"" id=""ffn89"">[89]</a></sup> Even though they are small in number, their effect is enormous. ""They never seem to sleep, guarding Israel's interests around the clock.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn90"" id=""ffn90"">[90]</a></sup> Henry Kissinger made the following comment on Israeli negotiating tactics: ""In the combination of single-minded persistence and convoluted tactics the Israelis preserve in the interlocutor only those last vestiges of sanity and coherence needed to sign the final document.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn91"" id=""ffn91"">[91]</a></sup></p>
<h2>IV. Jews Are Aggressive</h2>
<p>Being aggressive and ""pushy"" is part of the stereotype of Jews in Western societies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of scientific studies on this aspect of Jewish personality. Hans Eysenck, renowned for his research on personality, claims that Jews are indeed rated more aggressive by people who know them well.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn92"" id=""ffn92"">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jews have always behaved aggressively toward those they have lived among, and they have been perceived as aggressive by their critics. What strikes the reader of Henry Ford's <em>The International Jew</em> (<em>TIJ</em>), written in the early 1920s, is its portrayal of Jewish intensity and aggressiveness in asserting their interests.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn93"" id=""ffn93"">[93]</a></sup> As <em>TIJ</em> notes, from Biblical times Jews have endeavored to enslave and dominate other peoples, even in disobedience of divine command, quoting the Old Testament, ""And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.” In the Old Testament the relationship between Israel and foreigners is one of domination: For example, ""They shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over; And they shall fall down unto thee. They shall make supplication unto thee” (Isa. 45:14); ""They shall bow down to thee with their face to the earth, And lick the dust of thy feet” (49:23). Similar sentiments appear in Trito-Isaiah (60:14, 61:5-6), Ezekiel (e.g., 39:10), and Ecclesiasticus (36:9). The apotheosis of Jewish attitudes of conquest can be seen in the Book of Jubilees, where world domination and great reproductive success are promised to the seed of Abraham:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the God who created heaven and earth. I shall increase you, and multiply you exceedingly; and kings shall come from you and shall rule wherever the foot of the sons of man has trodden. I shall give to your seed all the earth which is under heaven, and they shall rule over all the nations according to their desire; and afterwards they shall draw the whole earth to themselves and shall inherit it for ever (Jub. 32:18-19).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere I have noted that a major theme of anti-Jewish attitudes throughout the ages has been Jewish economic domination.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn94"" id=""ffn94"">[94]</a></sup> The following petition from the citizens of the German town of Hirschau opposed allowing Jews to live there because Jews were seen as aggressive competitors who ultimately dominate the people they live among:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If only a few Jewish families settle here, all small shops, tanneries, hardware stores, and so on, which, as things stand, provide their proprietors with nothing but the scantiest of livelihoods, will in no time at all be superseded and completely crushed by these [Jews] such that at least twelve local families will be reduced to beggary, and our poor relief fund, already in utter extremity, will be fully exhausted within one year. The Jews come into possession in the shortest possible time of all cash money by getting involved in every business; they rapidly become the only possessors of money, and their Christian neighbors become their debtors.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn95"" id=""ffn95"">[95]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Late nineteenth-century Zionists such as Theodor Herzl were quite aware that a prime source of modern anti-Jewish attitudes was that emancipation had brought Jews into direct economic competition with the non-Jewish middle classes, a competition that Jews typically won. Herzl ""insisted that one could not expect a majority to ‘let themselves be subjugated' by formerly scorned outsiders whom they had just released from the ghetto.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn96"" id=""ffn96"">[96]</a></sup> The theme of economic domination has often been combined with the view that Jews are personally aggressive. In the Middle Ages Jews were seen as ""pitiless creditors.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn97"" id=""ffn97"">[97]</a></sup> The philosopher Immanuel Kant stated that Jews were ""a nation of usurers ...outwitting the people amongst whom they find shelter.... They make the slogan ‘let the buyer beware' their highest principle in dealing with us.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn98"" id=""ffn98"">[98]</a></sup></p>
<p>In early twentieth-century America, the sociologist Edward A. Ross commented on a greater tendency among Jewish immigrants to maximize their advantage in all transactions, ranging from Jewish students badgering teachers for higher grades to Jewish poor attempting to get more than the usual charitable allotment. ""No other immigrants are so noisy, pushing and disdainful of the rights of others as the Hebrews.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn99"" id=""ffn99"">[99]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The authorities complain that the East European Hebrews feel no reverence for law as such and are willing to break any ordinance they find in their way.... The insurance companies scan a Jewish fire risk more closely than any other. Credit men say the Jewish merchant is often ""slippery"" and will ""fail"" in order to get rid of his debts. For lying the immigrant has a very bad reputation. In the North End of Boston ""the readiness of the Jews to commit perjury has passed into a proverb.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn100"" id=""ffn100"">[100]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These characteristics have at times been noted by Jews themselves. In a survey commissioned by the American Jewish Committee's study of the Jews of Baltimore in 1962, ""two-thirds of the respondents admitted to believing that other Jews are pushy, hostile, vulgar, materialistic, and the cause of anti-Semitism. And those were only the ones who were willing to admit it.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn101"" id=""ffn101"">[101]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jews were unique as an American immigrant group in their hostility toward American Christian culture and in their energetic, aggressive efforts to change that culture.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn102"" id=""ffn102"">[102]</a></sup> From the perspective of Ford's <em>TIJ</em>, the United States had imported around 3,500,000 mainly Yiddish-speaking, intensely Jewish immigrants over the previous forty years. In that very short period, Jews had had enormous effect on American society, particularly in their attempts to remove expressions of Christianity from public life beginning with an attempt in 1899-1900 to remove the word ""Christian"" from the Virginia Bill of Rights: ""The Jews' determination to wipe out of public life every sign of the predominant Christian character of the U.S. is the only active form of religious intolerance in the country today.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn103"" id=""ffn103"">[103]</a></sup></p>
<p>A prototypical example of Jewish aggressiveness toward American culture has been Jewish advocacy of liberal immigration policies which have had a transformative effect on the U.S.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In undertaking to sway immigration policy in a liberal direction, Jewish spokespersons and organizations demonstrated a degree of energy unsurpassed by any other interested pressure group. Immigration had constituted a prime object of concern for practically every major Jewish defense and community relations organization. Over the years, their spokespersons had assiduously attended congressional hearings, and the Jewish effort was of the utmost importance in establishing and financing such non-sectarian groups as the National Liberal Immigration League and the Citizens Committee for Displaced Persons.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn104"" id=""ffn104"">[104]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jewish aggressiveness and their role in the media, in the creation of culture and information in the social sciences and humanities, and in the political process in the United States contrasts with the role of Overseas Chinese.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn105"" id=""ffn105"">[105]</a></sup> The Chinese have not formed a hostile cultural elite in Southeast Asian countries motivated by historical grievances against the people and culture of their hosts. For example, despite their economic dominance, the Chinese have not been concerned with restrictions on their citizenship rights, which have been common in Southeast Asia.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn106"" id=""ffn106"">[106]</a></sup> Whereas the Chinese have reacted rather passively to such restrictions, Jews have reacted to any manifestation of anti-Jewish attitudes or behavior with an all-out effort at eradication. Indeed, we have seen that the mainstream Jewish attitude is that even trivial manifestations of anti-Jewish attitudes and behavior must not be ignored because they can and will lead to mass murder. Not only have the Chinese not attempted to remove public displays of symbols of Indonesian nationalism and religion, they have not seriously attempted to change laws in place since the 1960s mandating that there be no public displays of Chinese culture.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn107"" id=""ffn107"">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>Besides the normal sorts of lobbying typical of the political process in the U.S., perhaps the clearest examples of Jewish aggressiveness are the many examples of intimidation of their opponents—loss of job, death threats, constant harassment, economic losses such as loss of advertising revenue for media businesses, and charges of anti-Semitism—the last being perhaps the greatest sin against the post-World War II political order that can be imagined. When Adlai Stevenson III was running for governor of Illinois, his record in opposition to Israeli settlement policy and his statement that the PLO was a legitimate voice of the Palestinian people resulted in a whisper campaign that he was an anti-Semite. Stevenson commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an intimidating, activist minority of American Jews that supports the decisions of the Israeli government, right or wrong. They do so very vocally and very aggressively in ways that intimidate others so that it's their voice—even though it is a minority— that is heard in American politics. But it still is much louder in the United States than in Israel. In other words, you have a much stronger, more vocal dissent in Israel than within the Jewish community in the United States. The prime minister of Israel has far more influence over American foreign policy in the Middle East than over the policies of his own government generally.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn108"" id=""ffn108"">[108]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common tactic has been to charge that critics of Israel are anti-Semites. Indeed, George Ball, a perceptive critic of Israel and its U.S. constituency, maintains that the charge of anti-Semitism and guilt over the Holocaust is the Israeli lobby's most effective weapon—outstripping its financial clout.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn109"" id=""ffn109"">[109]</a></sup> The utility of these psychological weapons in turn derives from the very large Jewish influence on the U.S. media. Historian Peter Novick notes regarding the importance of the Holocaust in contemporary American life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We [i.e., Jews] are not just ""the people of the book,"" but the people of the Hollywood film and the television miniseries, of the magazine article and the newspaper column, of the comic book and the academic symposium. When a high level of concern with the Holocaust became widespread in American Jewry, it was, given the important role that Jews play in American media and opinion-making elites, not only natural, but virtually inevitable that it would spread throughout the culture at large.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn110"" id=""ffn110"">[110]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, of course, the appeal to the Holocaust is especially compelling for American Jews. When the Mossad wants to recruit U.S. Jews for help in its espionage work, in the words of a CIA agent ""the appeal is a simple one: ‘When the call went out and no one heeded it, the Holocaust resulted.’”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn111"" id=""ffn111"">[111]</a></sup></p>
<p>Charges of anti-Semitism and guilt over the Holocaust are not the only instruments of Jewish aggressiveness on Israeli issues. Jewish groups intimidate their enemies by a variety of means. People who oppose policies on Israel advocated by Jewish activist organizations have been fired from their jobs, harassed with letters, subjected to intrusive surveillance, and threatened with death. Although there is a great deal of self-censorship in the media on Israel as a result of the major role of Jews in the ownership and production of the media, gaps in this armor are aggressively closed. There are ""threats to editors and advertising departments, orchestrated boycotts, slanders, campaigns of character assassination, and personal vendettas.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn112"" id=""ffn112"">[112]</a></sup> Other examples recounted by Findley include pressure on the Federal Communications Commission to stop broadcast licenses, demands for submission to an oversight committee prior to publication, and the stationing of a Jewish activist in the newsroom of the <em>Washington Post</em> in order to monitor the process.</p>
<p>The result of all this intense, well-organized aggression is that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who criticize Israeli policy in any sustained way invite painful and relentless retaliation, and even loss of their livelihood by pressure from one or more parts of Israel's lobby. Presidents fear it. Congress does its bidding. Prestigious universities shun academic programs and buckle under its pressure. Instead of having their arguments and opinions judged on merit, critics of Israel suddenly find their motivations, their integrity, and basic moral values called into question. No matter how moderate their criticism, they may be characterized as pawns of the oil lobby, apologists for Arabs, or even anti-Semitic.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn113"" id=""ffn113"">[113]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following quote from Henry Kissinger sums up the aggressive Israeli attitudes toward U.S. aid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yitzak [Rabin] had many extraordinary qualities, but the gift of human relations was not one of them. If he had been handed the entire ""United States Strategic Air Command"" as a free gift he would have (a) affected the attitude that at last Israel was getting its due, and (b) found some technical shortcoming in the airplanes that made his accepting them a reluctant concession to us.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn114"" id=""ffn114"">[114]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course by far the most important examples of Israeli aggressiveness have been toward their neighbors in the Middle East. This aggression has been there from the beginning, as Israel has consistently put pressure on border areas with incursions, including the Kibya massacre of 1953 led by Ariel Sharon.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn115"" id=""ffn115"">[115]</a></sup> The personal aggressiveness of Israeli society has long been a topic of commentators. Israel is known for its arrogance, insolence (chutzpah), coldness, roughness, rudeness, and lack of civility. For example, B. Z. Sobel, an Israeli sociologist at the University of Haifa, found that among the motivations for emigrating from Israel was that ""there is indeed an edginess [in Israeli society]; tempers flare, and verbal violence is rampant”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn116"" id=""ffn116"">[116]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The current situation in the United States is the result of an awesome deployment of Jewish power and influence. One must contemplate the fact that American Jews have managed to maintain unquestioned support for Israel over the last thirty-five years despite Israel's seizing land and engaging in a brutal occupation of the Palestinians in the occupied territories—an occupation that will most likely end with expulsion or complete subjugation, degradation, and apartheid. During this same period Jewish organizations in America have been a principal force—in my view the main force—for erecting a state dedicated to suppressing ethnic identification among Europeans, for encouraging massive multi-ethnic immigration into the U.S., and for erecting a legal system and cultural ideology that is obsessively sensitive to the complaints and interests of ethnic minorities: the culture of the Holocaust.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn117"" id=""ffn117"">[117]</a></sup></p>
<p>American Judaism is well organized and lavishly funded. It has achieved a great deal of power, and it has been successful in achieving its interests.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn118"" id=""ffn118"">[118]</a></sup> One of the great myths often promulgated by Jewish apologists is that Jews have no consensus and therefore cannot wield any real power. Yet there is in fact a great deal of consensus on broad Jewish issues, particularly in the areas of Israel and the welfare of other foreign Jewries, immigration and refugee policy, church-state separation, abortion rights, and civil liberties.<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn119"" id=""ffn119"">[119]</a></sup> Massive changes in public policy on these issues, beginning with the counter-cultural revolution of the 1960s, coincide with the period of increasing Jewish power and influence in the United States. Indeed, one is hard-pressed to find any significant area where public policy conflicts with the attitudes of mainstream Jewish organizations.</p>

He also notes that, ""In the world of animals, ants perhaps provide <em>Homo’s</em> nearest equivalent for typical broadness of niche. If an unspecialized ant species had a Bible, I'd expect to find in it extremely similar injunctions about food, ant genocide, and so forth, as I find in the actual Bible, and I would have no difficulty to suppose these as serving each ant colony well in its struggle for existence."" 271. <a href=""#ffn13"">↩</a></li>

<h3 class=""author-name""><a href=""/research/?author=553ab589e4b0462c778a4365"">Kevin MacDonald</a></h3>
<div class=""author-bio""><p>Kevin MacDonald is a retired Professor of  Psychology at California State University–Long Beach. After receiving a Masters degree in evolutionary biology, he received a Ph. D. in Biobehavioral Sciences, both at the University of Connecticut.  Since assuming his position at California State University–Long Beach, his research has focused on developing evolutionary perspectives on culture, developmental psychology and personality theory, the origins and maintenance of monogamous marriage in Western Europe, and ethnic relations (group evolutionary strategies). He is the author of more than 100 scholarly papers and reviews, and he is the author of Social and Personality Development: An Evolutionary Synthesis (1988), A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (1994), Separation and Its Discontents: Toward an Evolutionary Theory of Anti-Semitism (1998), and The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements (1998). He has also edited three books, Sociobiological Perspectives on Human Development (1988), Parent-Child Play: Descriptions and Implications (1994), and Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Development (2004). Cultural Insurrections, a collection of essays, appeared in 2008.

</em></p>
<p>Of the various subjects that American academics and intellectuals write about, none is more sensitive—if not actually dangerous—than the issue of ethnic influence, and no kind of ethnic influence is more sensitive and dangerous to discuss than Jewish influence. The essays in this collection by Professor Kevin MacDonald are among the few that have been written in recent years that deal with the subject both honestly and in depth, but no one should expect that his approach will protect him from the dangers his discussion invites.</p>
<p>Kevin MacDonald, of course, is the author of what is probably the most exhaustive study of the Jewish people, religion, and culture ever written—a trilogy that consists of volumes entitled <em>A People That Shall Dwell Alone</em> (1994), <em>Separation and Its Discontents</em>, and <em>The Culture of Critique</em> (both 1998). Originally published by the scientific firm Praeger and expensively priced, the volumes quickly became all but inaccessible but now have been reprinted in paperback editions and are available through Dr. MacDonald's <a href=""http://www.csulb.edu/%5C~kmacd/"">website</a>, as well as through major book distributors.</p>
<p>As happens to anyone who discusses Jewish influence openly and honestly, Dr. MacDonald was soon accused of ""anti-Semitism,"" and efforts were made to end his academic career, prevent him from publishing, and smear him as a scholar and a person. So far these efforts have been unsuccessful. He continues to hold his chair as Professor of Psychology at the University of California at Long Beach and to publish in his field of evolutionary psychology, in which he is a widely recognized authority.</p>
<p>MacDonald brings the perspective of his discipline to his examination of Jewish influence. The distinctive traits of Jewish culture and personality that he documents exhaustively throughout history from both Jewish and non-Jewish sources are, in his theory, the product of the evolutionary adaptation of the Jewish people as a group. In this respect, MacDonald's thesis bears a striking resemblance to that of Sir Arthur Keith, whose ""group selection"" theory of human evolution also included a study of the Jews as a group adapted by evolutionary forces to display characteristics of strong group identity and solidarity, traits that Keith described as reflecting a ""code of amity"" toward members of the group and a ""code of enmity"" towards outsiders. This ""dual code"" is strangely reminiscent of what the Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Jews of his era, as MacDonald quotes him: ""Among themselves they are inflexibly honest and ever ready to show compassion, though they regard the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies.""</p>
<p>There is, of course, nothing ""anti-Semitic"" about such a theory or its documentation. ""Anti-Semitism,"" in so far as it has any meaning, can refer only to hatred of or a desire to harm Jews, and there is nothing in what MacDonald has said or written that even approaches fitting that definition. The only basis for claiming it is ""anti-Semitic"" is to so broaden the meaning of the term as to include any attribution to Jews of characteristics that are not uniformly positive or to make any generalizations about them at all. For many who hurl the charge, that seems to be more than enough.</p>
<p>But of course, as with many others who have discussed (or tried to discuss or even to mention) the question of Jewish influence frankly—Pat Buchanan, Joe Sobran, Congressmen Paul Findley or James Moran, and more recently Gen. Anthony Zinni, Senator Ernest Hollings, or Ralph Nader—any effort to argue against the charge is fruitless. The accusation of ""anti-Semitism,"" much like those of ""racism,"" ""xenophobia,"" ""sexism,"" ""homophobia,"" etc., is essentially a power trip, an effort to avoid and destroy discussion of substantive issues and deflect it onto an ad hominem level that is impossible to deny or defend against. How do you ""prove"" you're not whatever bad name you have just been called? Any denial or defense is at once met with the charge that it ""just doesn't go far enough."" Of course not; it never does and never can. That's why the charge is so powerful and so dangerous, and those who hurl it are well aware of that. But in terms of their merits, these kinds of accusations don't even count. Invocations of such ""isms"" and ""phobias"" are invariably signs that those who hurl them have little of substance to say. As Peter Brimelow has noted, a ""racist"" is ""anyone who is winning an argument with a liberal,"" or for that matter a libertarian or, on some issues, a conservative. Much the same is true of most of those who are accused of being ""anti-Semites.""</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, the question of Jewish influence has popped into the mainstream media as it probably never has before in this country in the last century. First, as Dr. MacDonald discusses in some detail in his third essay in this book, it appeared in the issue of ""who got us into Iraq?"" It became clear even before hostilities erupted in April 2003 that a small group of policy-makers who were mainly Jewish and were closely connected to other Jewish publicists in the media were doing all they could to induce the Bush administration and the nation to embark on a war with Iraq, if not with other Arab states that they perceived as hostile to the state of Israel. To be sure, there were non-Jews involved in these activities—President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld not least, as well as any number of non-Jewish war hawks and professional conservatives like Rush Limbaugh—but the principal actors pressing for war from almost the beginning of the Bush administration were Jews—Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz (named by the <em>Jerusalem Post</em> as ""Man of the Year"" for his role in instigating the Iraq war), Richard Perle, Douglas Feith, and a number of others inside the Pentagon or other government departments and agencies, as well as such well-known Jewish commentators as Norman Podhoretz, Bill Kristol, Charles Krauthammer, Michael Ledeen, David Frum, and Josh Muravchik.</p>
<p>Moreover, article after article documenting their influence and their connections and their likely motivations—attachment to Israel and its interests in the Middle East—ap-peared in the mainstream, conservative, and liberal media and in articles not infrequently written by Jewish writers. As a result, the level of awareness of Jewish influence on public policy among many Americans has probably been greater in the last couple of years than ever before.</p>
<p>But on the heels of the Iraq war, there came yet another controversy that again highlighted Jewish influence, this time in popular culture, in the attacks on Mel Gibson's movie <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>. The controversy effectively began with attacks on the film by Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and reached a crescendo soon after the movie made its debut. Jewish reviewers such as Frank Rich of the <em>New York Times</em> wrote that the film was ""unambiguously contrived to vilify Jews”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn1"" id=""ffn1"">[1]</a></sup>; Leon Wieseltier in <em>The New Republic</em> claimed that Gibson ""has chosen to give millions of people the impression that Jews are culpable for the death of Jesus,”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn2"" id=""ffn2"">[2]</a></sup> and Jamie Bernhard opened her review in the <em>New York Daily News</em> with the statement that ""Mel Gibson's <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> is the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II.”<sup><a class=""footnote"" href=""#fn3"" id=""ffn3"">[3]</a></sup> Nevertheless, despite receiving more hostile publicity than any other mainstream movie in history, <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> quickly generated record audiences and record revenues for its producer and director. The attack on the film failed, despite the ability of its mainly Jewish enemies to orchestrate an immense amount of hostility to and outright vilification of it and Gibson himself.</p>
<p>MacDonald only briefly mentions the Gibson controversy, but virtually everything about it fits his model of ""Jewish influence"" and his theory of the ""culture of critique"" that Jews have constructed. What MacDonald offers largely explains why so many Jews have reacted so strongly to any perceived threat, why they tend to perceive even innocuous remarks and actions as threatening, and how they coordinate and mobilize financial, political, and public opinion resources to crush what they perceive.</p>
<p>What his theory does not explain is why non-Jews put up with it and go along with it. What is clear in the two cases just mentioned, the Iraq war and the Gibson controversy, is that Jewish influence amounts to very little if those over whom it is wielded recognize it and reject it. Jewish policy-wonks may have instigated the Iraq war, but their role in doing so and their resort to what certainly were distortions and may have been outright fabrications of intelligence on ""weapons of mass destruction"" and supposed Iraqi links with international terrorism soon became notorious and effectively discredited those who concocted them. The Gibson assault, for all the massive financial and media resources deployed, proved to be a total failure, as millions of Americans flocked to theaters to see the movie and the film grossed hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>What is clear in the aftermath of these episodes is that ""Jewish power” exists at all only because the gentiles who are supposedly enslaved to it either fail to see it or refuse to resist it. At the slightest breath of air and light, it collapses—which is why anyone who talks about it is so quickly damned and silenced as an ""anti-Semite.' But what is not clear is why gentiles tolerate Jewish power and Jewish influence at all.</p>
<p>Dr. MacDonald should definitely turn his attentions and energies to that question. In the meantime, what he has already accomplished is far more than most others accomplish in the course of a lifetime. Whether we embrace his entire theory or not, what we can learn from his scholarship and thought rewards the effort of assimilating it. The essays he offers in this book are a good place to begin doing so.</p>
